The most important thing obviously regarding anything you do in your life is your mindset and that's the first lesson about this it's the G mindset you know a lot of people messaged me saying "Why did you call it GCourse you could have called it something more serious." No I like that name i like I like G that's what it is it's a G mindset we're going to learn something about ourselves we're going to learn something about how you how do you view the world because in reality how you view the world absolutely and utterly shapes how you react to the world how you act in the world how people view you it's all down to how you view things there's very few things in this life we actually have any control over i learned all of the lessons I'm going to be teaching you the hard way i didn't learn them in a course so you guys are very very lucky i learned all this [ __ ] the absolute hard way i came from absolutely nothing there's a lot of rumors circulating online that you know my father was a world double chess player and that I got a lot of money from him and I came from a rich family etc etc absolutely not the case my dad was uh a G a straight G he was in the military he was based in England in the Air Force my dad was actually recruited into the CIA he was a spy now he's he's dead i'm I'm happy to say that uh so my father worked for the intelligence services he was based in England he met my mom uh pretty little white thing he's a big black dude so back then that was that was a taboo he he grabbed her took her took her back to America with him uh three beautiful offspring me being the the oldest uh and then he continued with his life of being a G which is pimp and hose and playing chess at world level and traveling and traveling the earth he never had any large financial sums he certainly didn't leave me a penny um he didn't have anything to leave so all he left me with was with a mindset and that mindset was enough that allowed me to build the life I wanted to build my father never wanted to be fiscally rich he never gave a [ __ ] about being rich and care about other things if he wanted to be rich he would have been extremely rich um and I personally decided I wanted to be rich and all of the lessons that I'm going to be putting in this course a lot are from him and a lot are from experiences of growing up poor growing up in a single mother household growing up in social housing or the projects in England uh when my mother and father split I was 9 years old i went to England um becoming a world level athlete uh and now becoming a self-made multi-millionaire so all of these lessons I've learned absolutely the hard way and if you disagree with anything in this video that is your prerogative but I can absolutely assure you I know what I'm [ __ ] talking about i know what I'm talking about i've lived an extreme life there's a lot of people online who give out advice that's fine but I've lived an extreme life more extreme than most i have been in a single mother my mom crying because she can't pay the bills broke as a joke i've been a multi-millionaire i've been a nobody i've been uh famous i've been a worldle athlete i've I've started from nothing where the point where I had to run to the gym because I didn't even have a car to get there i've done it all so I've I've I've lived a very extreme life and this is where these lessons come from so when I talk about G mindset G mindset is absolutely and utterly the most important thing this is actually quite funny uh a girl I was dating once she said to me you know you remind me of RuPaul and RuPaul is a famous [ __ ] drag queen so it's not very great i was like why she goes because he has a saying he said I always knew I was famous i had to wait for the rest of the world to catch up and she goes you have the same mindset she said this to me before I had nothing because I told everyone I'm going to be world champion years before I even had a British title before I even had an English title I just started fighting i was like "Oh I'm the next world champion." Yeah yeah and just just I just started saying it but I said it with genuine conviction i knew I would be the best i genuinely knew I would be the best you have to understand that this world everyone constantly tells you do not be arrogant do not have an ego when I had my Twitter I I put my ego into overdrive because I found it entertaining but people will constantly tell you to to not talk in a way which is full of conviction they people do not like you to have be arrogant and have an ego this is the worst thing ever let me tell you a fact number one facet of a G mindset your life is never going to be worse if you walk through the world believing you are the [ __ ] man you wake up look in the mirror and go I'm the I'm the [ __ ] man i am the man there's no one on this planet who can do [ __ ] I couldn't do if I put my mind to it i don't give a [ __ ] how good you are at piano if I decide to play piano I would be better than you at piano and I believe that i don't just say these things i [ __ ] believe them and when you go through life believing you really really are the man there are very few downsides the downsides are everyone's going to call you an arrogant everyone's going to call you arrogant everyone's going to call you a [ __ ] everyone's going to say he has a big ego you're going to lose a few loser friends who cares what you are going to gain is other people on the same path you're going to gain other people who think "Yeah well I'm the [ __ ] man too this guy's the man let's make some money." That's what's going to happen so the first thing you can do with your G mindset is you need to start believing you are the [ __ ] man even if you're not the man yet even before I was world champion I knew I was going to be the man so I don't give a [ __ ] and I was happy to say that to anybody when people call me arrogant and stupid and deluded I just sit there and look at them and say "Yeah [ __ ] you i'm going to be the man." And this is how now when my life's kind of come full circle this is quite interesting i'll tell you a very quick story when I was 19 I think I had a sales job and I had to drive uh I had to drive down to a sales meeting to try and sell some advertising i had a really old shitty car no I must I must have been older than 19 i was about 21 i had this old [ __ ] car and I'm driving and as I'm driving my car and I couldn't afford to have it fixed i had a bump in the front the front was all [ __ ] caved in so I had to park it away from the sales meeting then walk to the sales meeting so I'm driving this car anyway pull up next to me at the lights red light pull up next to me in a [ __ ] Tuesday morning 10:00 music blasting drop top Aston Martin with a Swedish number plate some [ __ ] dude about 30 with a hot blonde next to him and I remember looking at him thinking who how who the [ __ ] this guy like here I am with my broken car on my way to [ __ ] do a [ __ ] job i can't afford to fix my car this guy is from [ __ ] Sweden and he's just driven to England and he's got a Swedish plate and he's got this hot [ __ ] and he's got music pumping and he's on his way to have lunch like where the [ __ ] did my life go wrong i want to be like that guy and and I think this every single time I live in Romania now and now I drive around Romania in my [ __ ] Lamborghini or my Aston Martin or my Ferrari or my Bentley whichever one I decide to drive and they all have English number plates and I always have a girl with me and people look at me and people are giving me the exact same look I gave that guy people look at me like "Who the [ __ ] this guy from England who just drove here from England i'm standing at the bus stop about to go to work and this guy's got a quarter of a million dollar car and a hot [ __ ] on his way to have lunch with music blaring." And the reason I managed to to to go full circle is those small events in my life seeing someone else with more success than me ingrained in my brain and to a lot of people it doesn't ingrain in their brain i was walking to school if I was walking to to college with my friends I used to have to walk i went to a college on the other side of town so I had to walk four 4.6 I think it was [ __ ] miles to college it was a [ __ ] nightmare so I had to walk walk halfway I meet some other people and towards the end there' be a group of five or six of us along the way and when I met and one day a Ferrari burnt past us and everyone else is like yeah Ferrari i'm like and I remember saying to the group I was only 18 i said doesn't it annoy you that this guy has a [ __ ] 300,000 pound car and and we'll probably never have one and they're like oh yeah it's only a car i'm like no you don't understand there is a life hack there's something happening where people are living lives that other people don't get to live there's something happening there's something going on i want to have a 300,000 pound car i want it and no one else wanted it these little events didn't ingrain in their brain ferrari driving past me bothered me and it bothered me to my core to the point where I decided I would do anything it takes to have one whereas other people just saw it and carried on with their normal lives this is the reason I have six or seven supercars and other people don't because these small events ingrained in my brain so this is the second thing G mindset first thing is you have to believe you're the [ __ ] man you can achieve anything and when I say that I don't want I'm going to say that again you have to believe you're the [ __ ] man and you have to believe you can achieve anything i'm not saying you can achieve anything easily i'm not saying it's not going to take a whole bunch of work i'm not saying it's going to happen quickly but you have to believe you can achieve anything tell you something now i don't give a [ __ ] if it's being an astronaut i don't care about climbing Mount Everest you give me enough time to train I will get it done i know that for a fact because I know who I am as a man that's the first thing the second thing is you need to be persspeacious you need to understand that in this world there's a whole bunch of people doing amazing [ __ ] that you are not doing and that needs to piss you off because it pisses you off you become motivated all of a sudden i was the only one who was pissed off when that Aston Martin was next to me and I had my sales job i was the only one who was pissed off when I saw that Ferrari drive past other people were not annoyed by it and they're not annoyed by it they're not driven to beat it you understand and they're not driven to be where that person was you need to be annoyed and I'm telling you I'm telling you to be angry anger is a fantastic force like I said the world tells you not to be arrogant it tells you not to be angry it's two things it tells you to do don't be arrogant don't have an ego and you know you don't have anger you're a [ __ ] man you're a full-g grown man it's perfectly fine for you to be pissed off it's perfectly fine for you to look around at your life look at the girl you're [ __ ] look at the house you live in look at the car you drive and get pissed off and go "You know what i want a hotter [ __ ] i want a [ __ ] nicer house i want a faster car there's nothing wrong if you take that anger and you direct it in the correct direction this is the reason I stopped fighting now people go "Why do you stop fighting?" Because I fought and I went through hell to get everything I now have i had nothing when I fought i had nothing and I wanted the life I now have now I wake up in one of my three mansions with one of my seven supercars and one of my 15 women what do I need to fight for like people have different motivations for different things there's some fighters out there who fight for other reasons you know my motivation was I was pissed off at the world and now I'm not as angry as I used to be so I don't believe I'm as good a fighter as I used to be i'll still whoop some ass but I'm not as good as I used to be so that's why I decided to retire early but this is the second thing first thing believe you're the man second thing you need to get angry about your situation if you've bought this course and you're watching it and you're sitting there right now you're watching it and you look around you and you don't own the home you're in get pissed off if there ain't a Ferrari on your drive get pissed off if you don't have 10 Playboy Bunny level beauties get pissed off and what the [ __ ] You need to sit there and realize whoa whoa whoa i have a few years of consciousness and even less than that I have a few short years as a young man because age will damage you i mean if you're a millionaire when you're 60 is not nearly as good as being a millionaire at my age i became a millionaire at 28 so you need to realize you got a few short years as a young man you're [ __ ] wasting it you need to sit there and go "Fuck shit." get angry because getting angry forced directed anger is an extremely powerful force so these are the first two things you need to do for a G mindset this is the third thing and this is a very very important thing because I try and explain this to people and they don't seem to understand it so I'm going to make this very very blunt nobody absolutely nobody gives a [ __ ] about you as much as you're going to have to give a [ __ ] about yourself nobody cares about you as much as they need to care to fix your life even your parents even your friends even all the people who think they care about you they care about you yeah sure there may be two or three people on the planet who genuinely care about you but nobody is going to come to your bed drag you out of bed [ __ ] drag you to a job force you to work hard go and get you a hot [ __ ] and go and buy you a Ferrari nobody is going to do that for you you are never going to have any of the things you want if you do not get them yourself nobody cares about you enough to do it for you this is absolutely true personally I'm an atheist and when I say I'm an atheist people say people seem to be a bit confused by this i don't know why that surprises people but I'm absolutely and utterly an atheist and the reason I'm atheist is because I believe that there is no grand plan there's no God in the sky looking out for me i don't believe that there's anyone here to save me on this planet or in in the sky or anywhere else i am me i was born i have maybe if I'm lucky 70 because I'm I'm quite big when you're physically large you die sooner 70 years of consciousness and these years I experience the only person who's going to make them fun and exciting and interesting the only person who's going to make me happy and live a life that I want to live is me nobody's going to do it for me no god has a plan for me there's no one else who wakes up each day and goes "You know what i want to make Andrew Tate's life better i want to get him more [ __ ] and more money." No one thinks that about me no one thinks that about you either nobody thinks that about you the only person who gives a [ __ ] about your life truly is you and if you don't give a [ __ ] then you're [ __ ] but point two get angry you're going to start giving a [ __ ] very soon and after you get angry you need to realize that nobody is going to give you the things you want it doesn't matter if Donald Trump is president or not i'm a huge Trump fan but it doesn't make a difference no politician's going to make you rich no one else is going to come along and say "I'm going to concentrate my effort on fixing your life." Nobody you have to understand you are out here alone absolutely alone and when you understand these three things you start to see how a mindset comes together nobody's going to save you you're [ __ ] it's totally down to you you're pissed off with your current situation and you want to change it plus you believe you can do absolutely anything this is how I thought at 18 years old this is how I achieved so much in the short years this is how I went from a nobody to a world level athlete and a multimillionaire also people confuse the two kickboxing is not boxing i made in across my entire career in kickboxing maybe about 700,000 i I now have about eight or nine million this was not made in kickboxing this was made in other ventures i have managed to be a worldle athlete and an extremely successful businessman at exactly the same time because at a very young age when I had my prime resource of energy and power at 18 19 years old I understood those three tenants i believe I can do anything i'm pissed off I don't have the life I want and nobody else is going to give it to me these are three things you need to understand if any one of these elements is missing you'll never have the right mindset the G mindset will never formulate if any one of these elements is missing all three are absolutely essential and the sooner you get your act together the sooner you start to panic and worry and be concerned that you're 24 25 you're not [ __ ] rich yet there's 24 and 25 year olds out there who got a contract for a [ __ ] NBA or their parents or they won the lottery or who knows what there's 24 and 25 year olds out there who are multi-millionaires [ __ ] the hot models these Instagram girls with three million followers they're getting [ __ ] by someone and it ain't you and that needs to piss you off you need to get concerned you get worried you [ __ ] I'm running out of time you need to get some urgency in your life put these three things together is absolutely essential this is the beginning of the G mindset when you have these things three things totally done I'll tell you what happens tell you what happened for me so I became a ser so my brother used to say you become a Ser and what that means is I made a pact to him that my word was unbreakable strength and honor and that if I said something I meant it so I'd wake up in the morning and I'd say to my brother I'm doing a thousand pressups today once I said it once I spoke it it's like like a genie it became true if I said I was going to do a thousand press ups I'd do them because if I didn't do them I'd feel guilty within myself that I was the kind of person who talks [ __ ] because G's don't talk [ __ ] so the three tenants we've already learned when you've instilled these in your mind you don't want to be the kind of person who talks [ __ ] so if I woke up to my brother said "I'm doing a thousand press ups or I'm running 20 miles today." I would do it because if I didn't do it I'd feel like a [ __ ] because when you instill these mindsets when you when your mindset changes you start to be extremely accountable for yourself no one's coming to save you you become extremely accountable so when you realize that your word is one of the few things you have on this planet if you say things you're going to start sticking to them so then it becomes very easy to train you say "I'm going to train every day this week i'm going to trade for two hours a day soon as you said it it's basically done if I say something it's basically done it's it's set in stone if I say something I'm going to do it there's no way I'm going to say I'm going to make say some words and speak them into existence in this on this planet and then I'm going to be the kind of [ __ ] who quits because it's too hard if I say I'm going to do 10,000 push-ups I'm going to do them because I'm the kind of person who sticks to the words he says and this is another thing you need to understand with the G mindset you have to be very very specific with what you say because if you instill your mindset correctly and you start to just say things just start saying things then you hold yourself accountable say things you don't even think you want to do wake up and go up to your friend or your mom or whoever and say "You know what i'm going to do a thousand push-ups today." Say it to people and they're going to say "No you're not." So watch me and then you have a choice you're either going to succeed like a G or you're going to be a little [ __ ] and you're going to quit at 310 because it's hard what kind of man are you that's a decision you need to make but if you're the kind of man I was I'd say [ __ ] and I'd [ __ ] stick to it my brother say "You've become a say." I used to train with my brother he'd say "Let's do 500." I said "Let's do 2,000." He'd say "You've said it now so we have to do it." I like "Exactly i said it now so now we have to do it there is no surrender i we have to do it." This is another facet of the G mindset this is number four you got to start saying [ __ ] and your word has to be iron unbreakable this translates across everything in life it's not just training it translates across everything in life even relationships i say to my girlfriend "Stop [ __ ] with me or you're out the house." Men say that all the time in arguments and then they continue to argue for two hours they'll say that and then they'll argue if I say that and she continues to talk [ __ ] i start throwing her [ __ ] out the [ __ ] door because I said it and if I say something I mean it if I look a man in his eyes say "I'm going to whoop your ass shut up." And he continues to talk i have to kick his ass i'm careful with what I say if I tell him to shut up and he doesn't shut up that's a different thing if I say shut up or I'm going to whoop your ass and he continues to talk I will [ __ ] him up because I'm the kind of person if I say something I mean what I say i'm specific with my language and I mean every word I speak this is another tip this is number four you have to start meaning every word you speak you say to someone "I'm going to get rich." You better [ __ ] do it otherwise you're a liar you're a liar and you're a little [ __ ] if you say "I'm going to put some muscle on." You better [ __ ] do it you say "I'm going to lift this weight," you better [ __ ] do it you say "I'm going to go get this girl you better go get her." You got to be the kind of person who says things and mean to them you promise a guy you're going to whoop his ass you better whoop his ass don't be a person 99% of the people out here talk [ __ ] they say things they half mean or things they don't mean if I say something I [ __ ] mean it and this is number four this is the fourth element you've heard the first three this is number four everything you say you must mean and once you implement that correctly then you get the ability to motivate yourself to no end you get unlimited motivation because all you have to do is find the energy to say it you find the energy to say it then you have to do it it's literally that easy i'd wake up in the morning and say "Tristan we're running 20 miles today." I need to say "Oh for [ __ ] sake." That's nearly a marathon i'm like "Yep let's go." Because Maver takes all [ __ ] day i said it and if I say something it has to happen this is the fourth tenant and one of the most important ones because that is the power to unlimited motivation and that's the power to being taken seriously across all spheres of your life be specific with your language i was in a restaurant the other day some guy was arguing with his girlfriend and they were talking [ __ ] he's like you better be quiet better be quiet he kept saying you better be but there was no threat at the end of it i didn't really like that like if you're going to make a threat make a [ __ ] threat idiot but my point is he's trying to make a threat but he has no threat at the end because it's empty and the [ __ ] is ignoring him all these things translate across your entire sphere or if you say to a girl or a guy "You better be quiet or else." And then you don't follow through they're going to remember that [ __ ] even on a subconscious level they're going to remember that [ __ ] your word's going to be devalued my word has value literally I can go into let's say the Ferrari dealership I get my cars from i can say "I'll pay you tomorrow." And shake his hand he'll give me the car he knows me i can go and get my car fixed and say "I'll be back on Monday i got something to sort out." He'll shake my hand i don't lie if I say I'll be back on Monday and I don't have money on Monday I'll rob a bank to make sure I have money on Monday because I [ __ ] said I'd be there to pay this is the kind of person you need to be so these are the first four elements to the G mindset and when these sound like simple things but to implement them correctly truly and correctly in your mind will change your entire view of the world you will start to look at everything completely differently when you implement these four things correctly when you say if I say something I'm going to do it my word is iron willed when you say that nobody is ever coming to save me ever when you say that I'm pissed off I don't have the life I want to have and you couple that with I believe I can do anything if you truly believe all of these four things it's going to change your entire view of this planet i'll wrap up quickly with probably my most famous tweet when I had Cobra tape they they verified me and everything and I spoke too much truth so I had to go when my for my most famous tweet was when I said depression wasn't real and I had aist celebrities i had the girl from Game of Thrones i had [ __ ] literally A-list guys because who's that dude from No Country from Old for Old Men and he was a bad guy in Bond as well i actually quite liked him as an actor until he came for me i was having arguments with all these people and everyone's telling me how how dangerous my mindset is what is dangerous about believing that you control your own mind because if you implement the four things I've just told you depression becomes a becomes garbage depression is not a thing anymore feeling depressed is real you can be depressed with your situation i just told you number two get depressed that's fine but believing you can fix it yourself is the important key sitting there believing that depression is some monster from the sky that strikes your brain and now you have no control over and you must take pills every day is the absolute enemy to a G mindset i don't give a [ __ ] how depressing my situation the only person who can change it is me the only person who can change how I feel about my situation or try and affect the situation directly is me even if you put me in a situation I can't change if you put me in jail and I'm depressed because I'm in jail I still refuse to succumb to depression i refuse to collapse mentally and give up i know the only person who can control my mind is me nobody's coming to save me no doctor with a pill is coming to save me depression isn't real depression is a state of mind designed to motivate you to find a life that doesn't depress you any further that's all it is now you have to decide are you man enough to go and get it done or you going to sit around and cry and depression the reason I talk about depression a lot is because depression in the western world is the cure all it's the cure all excuse this is what people are using my life's [ __ ] because I'm depressed no you're depressed because your life is [ __ ] it's the other way round and you're refusing to acknowledge that and you want to sit there and live a [ __ ] life and pretend that some disease has struck you and the reason you know that's [ __ ] anyone out there who's depressed I'll tell you something you're not depressed you're a coward and the reason you're a coward is as follows you desperately try to defend this crippling ailment you have when I tell you depression isn't real you message me pages and pages desperate to convince me I'm wrong that depression is a real thing and that your life is terrible and this ailment has destroyed your life because you're desperate to defend your excuse if depression was really terrible you wouldn't want to defend it if depression was really so bad and I'm telling you it's not real and I know how to fix you and if you implement a mindset like mine you become immune to depression if depression was so terrible you'd listen to me and think I need to try what this guy does i had to if he's immune to depression it's impossible to depress him i need to be like this man but instead no you don't want to do that you want to call me names and sit and defend this ailment because you know it's garbage it's your excuse it's your blanket it's your shield it's your excuse you get to pull out every time you look at your failure of a life and that's why depression is absolutely and utterly not real and anyone who's bought this course who thinks they're depressed I'll tell you something now drop that coward [ __ ] if you're watching this and you're depressed drop and give me 200 press ups do 200 press ups look in the mirror look in the your eyes and tell yourself you're the [ __ ] man and drop that garbage because you can get absolutely nowhere in your life if you believe in that crap depression absolutely isn't real and that you're going to say this to people and they're going to [ __ ] go nuts at you and they're going to call you arrogant they're going to call you all the things they call me but your life is going to be a life worth living implement the four things I've told you the four important tenants of a G mindset understand nobody's coming to save you depression isn't real you'll change your entire worldview once these four things are implemented correctly and then we can move on to everything else right we've been over the mindset the mindset the four tenants of the mindset are believe you can do absolutely anything two be pissed off you haven't done it yet three absolutely nobody is coming to save you before your word has to be iron willed and use that for unlimited motivation this is about body language i like to look at humans from an evolutionary standpoint i like to look at us as a species because like I said I'm an atheist i do not believe that God put us here we're no special we're not special we're no different than any other animal here okay we're more intelligent but there's always going to be a smartest you know we're not the fastest or the strongest or anything else so we're an animal species and if you look at humans uh from that perspective and you look at men males and I'm assuming like I said previously most of you are men males for a very long period of time had a very physical role our role was combatants our role was a combative role our role was to protect or to destroy or to dominate or to conquer this was a male's role so in the modern society where we pretend physicality isn't important and we deny physicality and people say it doesn't matter it absolutely does matter for Because since the dawn of human time my favorite saying that everyone mocks me before since the dawn of human time for 95% of our existence a man's role was primarily a physical role so physicality is extremely important and when you're looking at body language it's quite difficult to have the body language of an alpha what is an alpha let me diverse quickly what is an alpha if you look in the a lion's pride who's the alpha the alpha is the biggest strongest lion this is this is the alpha the alpha is the badass so can you mimic the body language of a biggest longest strongest lion yeah of course but if you're not the biggest strongest lion you know it's not as easy to pull off and someone might call you bluff so this is actually a very easy video body language is down to your physicality as a whole uh the body language of a G is a combative body language i'm not saying you walk through life like this like looking for a fight not at all but you have to have a presence about you whereas you're not an easy target it's quite funny actually because when you're a fighter you can spot other fighters a mile off like and it's not just big muscly guys like you can put me in a room with and 30 guys who go to the gym who are fitness experts can come in and walk through and if one of them is a highlevel combatant if one of them is a a professional fighter like me I can I can tell by the way he moves probably the same way a dancer can sense another dancer i can sense another fighter and it's something instinctual it's something I can't even tell you how I do it i can just tell by the way someone moves if they can fight or if they can't fight doesn't matter they have the best body in the world they can be ripped but it's the way they move i know I've seen guys who don't have a body like that and I can sense it and I've seen guys who are built like that and I could just tell they would crumble it really is an amazing thing and I think this is something that you become more tuned into more honed on when you're a fighter yourself but it's obviously something that humans naturally possess we naturally possess the ability to spot another male and think that guy's a dangerous guy so I can tell you tips and tricks in an attempt to mimic the body language of a dangerous person or you can become a dangerous person this course is not a shortcut course this is not tips and tricks this is not [ __ ] this is about how to become a gene how to become a genuine ass a genuine male of substance and to become a genuine male of substance you need to know how to fight it's very difficult to be a G if you're going through life and you crumble at at at physical confrontation because when you get to a certain point in your life you will encounter physical confrontations if you're going to go and travel the world and drive fast cars and wear expensive things and attempt to [ __ ] beautiful women all over this planet sooner or later you're going to attract negative intention from either jealous men or an ex-boyfriend or a brother or who [ __ ] a [ __ ] robber who wants your car who knows are you really a G if you mimic every single as aspect of a high quality man and then when that situation happens you you fold no of course you're not you need to learn how to fight i don't need to teach you how to fight i don't need to sit here in this course and say "Do this do that do that." I don't need to teach you any of that because you can go and doesn't matter what city you are on Earth there's an MMA class or there's a boxing class that will teach you how to fight you need to dedicate substantial periods and and and and portions of your time to learning how to fight you need to get hit you need to have your ass kicked you need to learn how to kick someone's ass and this is absolutely essential to one the mindset and two the physicality firstly mindset wise fighting is a is a brilliant thing because fighting is 100% accountable even if you play soccer for example even if your team wins maybe you didn't do very much or maybe you kicked the ball and the wind helped you who knows but fighting if you got punched in the face you didn't move and if you punched him in the face you threw your hand in fighting we always say there's no such thing as a lucky punch and it's true you know I if I dedicate my life to learning how to punch and then I knock someone out is it a lucky punch no i knocked them out that's that's what I've been training to do no such thing as a lucky punch so mindset wise it's perfect for your accountability secondly it's a huge challenge learning how to fight is extremely difficult it's more difficult than learning how to dance or learning how to do anything else and the reason for this is because learning how to fight all humans have an instinctual way of fighting we don't have an instinctual way to dance as much but all humans basically are pre-programmed to fight but the way we're pre-programmed to fight is completely wrong we're pre-programmed to lift our head up so we look big and we can see and and to swing with our hands low for maximum power and these are completely wrong in terms of traditional chin down hands up fighting so when you're learning to fight you're you're reprogramming your basic instincts and this is why it's so difficult this is why it takes more practice than any other sport i could learn to dance much easier than a dancer could learn to fight at high level um and that's because fighting is extremely chaotic it's extremely quick it hurts and on top of that you're trying to reprogram a basic instinct so it's a very difficult thing to do but if you want to become a G for real you need to learn how to fight and once you learn how to fight your body language when I say once you learn how to fight learning how to fight takes years once you start to begin to learn how to fight it's a lifestyle choice this is not a I do a six week course and I know how to fight no this is a lifestyle choice where you start to dedicate a certain period of your time every single week to being a combative individual and it's something that you never really give up on because you never completely learn how to fight so it's something you're going to have to change your lifestyle and base it around but when you start to do that your body language is going to change and once again just like in the first lesson when you start to do that the way you interact and view the world will start to change the way you view other people will start to change this is the great thing about especially when I had Twitter and the internet i wasn't I wasn't big on Twitter until Trump was Trump was elected and that's when I started to tweet and they verified me straight away and I got mixed up and everything went crazy but um you realize that 99% of the people on there with their opinions who were being rude would never speak to you that way in in in real life it never bothered me it didn't ever upset me but when I was on Twitter I'd never been spoken to that way in real life nobody ever spoke to me that way no one ever argued with me that way and I thought well why is that and I thought because I have a physical presence that even I was unaware of if I sit with someone who hates Trump in real in the real world the way they speak to me is completely different than they do on Twitter because even subconsciously they're thinking this guy is a dangerous guy and even if even if they know I'd never attack them because I'm not I'm not an idiot i'm not an animal i don't have a criminal record i'm not I'm not a thug but instinctually inside of their mind from an evolutionary standpoint they're thinking this is not the kind of guy you you call names this is not the kind of guy you talk to in that manner and it's that was a really great experiment for me to see the way that people talk to you through a computer and the way that I've never been interacted with that way in real life and I was like well why is that because I said this to someone else like "Oh people talk to me like that all the time." It's like well yeah it was because you're you and I'm me so a physical presence is is a real thing and it's a real thing one with other males this is certainly a real thing with females absolutely a real thing with females and this is something that either I can teach you to imitate i can tell you tips and tricks or you can just go and [ __ ] do it if you go and do it for real you don't need tips and tricks are you going to be world champion no because I'm in the top 0.1% of of physical athletes but can you be good sure you can be good and is it going to damage your life in any way to dedicate specific time learning how to fight of course not you're going to be in physical better physical condition better mental condition you're going to have a better body language because a male's body language is a combative body language that's what men are meant to do we are meant to fight we're meant to conquer this is why men have been men since the dawn of human time this is why the Romans got some rocks melted the rocks made swords these [ __ ] they didn't have Google Maps they didn't know where they were going they thought let's just walk in this direction and then we're going to find some people and we're going to kill them and we're going to take all our women and we're going to conquer their city because we want to this is what men have been built to do since the dawn of human time men are combative individuals so to pretend that combat is not real anymore and we live in society and you don't have to all garbage you know and this is western society [ __ ] anyway if you've been I've been to 71 countries if you go to the places I've been you will realize that physical presence is still a very real thing absolutely a very real thing in many parts of this planet still today so body language of a G is a very very short but simple lesson one go and learn to fight because a man's body language needs to be a combative body language and there's no point in me teaching you how to imitate that when you can go and learn it for real that's the first thing go and learn how to fight and that's it it's really that simple if you want a body language which really does display your value as a high value male then go and become one and learning how to fight is is the easiest way to do that all right so I'm going to talk about how to use your voice to make the [ __ ] moist now what do I mean by that well the reality is most men nowadays walk around very timidly they're very soft with their voice and they don't command the room right they don't command someone's attention so here's an example let's say you're going to Starbucks and you're going to get you a cappuccino right maybe you drink soy lattes whatever but when you order a lot of people are timid like "Oh I I love have the uh I have the number three." Right and then if someone doesn't hear them they just kind of sit back and and let it be instead of commanding the person who's working attention right so if I were to walk up and order a soy latte I would walk up like "Excuse me I'll take a number three." Right you're commanding their attention you're commanding what you want so the thing is you want to command attention right if a king walks in a room do you think he's timid so you have to think this whole course the whole point is you have to start considering yourself a king right you're a king of your domain you're a king of your state you're a king of your country you're a king of the world right when you walk into a room you're commanding it when you talk to someone you're using your voice to make a point right you seeing how I'm pausing so a lot of people will be like "Well I don't have a naturally deep voice man like I don't sound like you." That's fine every [ __ ] man can absolutely take voice lessons can you not right can you not take voice lessons it's not even that expensive you go down to a community college in the States maybe I don't know what they call it in other countries junior college whatever you can go and literally pay a few bucks and get voice lessons and learn how to speak from here right and learn how to use your voice to compel people look at all another thing you can do which is excellent and this is how I learned how to speak watch speeches and watch interviews with Bill Clinton so [ __ ] the politics right [ __ ] all the politics [ __ ] who cares i don't care about that bill Clinton's one of the most charismatic people in the world and watch how he moves watch how he speaks watch how deliberate he is barack Obama I've actually met charismatic but not I don't think he was that like extremely effective with his speech but he does have a way he's a cadence and how he speaks and says things so when it comes to girls it's an absolute scientific fact that women are turned on by voice right a deep voice it's it's just because it's manly right it it's telling them subconsciously is high testosterone therefore he'll be good to breed with and this baby will actually survive so when you're talking to girls not just lowering your voice a bit but slowing it down so think about this if you have someone who's nervous around pretty girls which is natural but you have to you have to work through that and they're they're with a pretty girl hey uh what's your name where are you from okay cool yeah I'm right they're they're getting their words out someone who feels like they're not heard or people don't respect them will speak quickly in order to get it all out before someone interrupts them it's very [ __ ] true someone who's used to being respected or or having establishing boundaries in the sense of don't cut me off don't talk over me they'll pause and what I do cuz people will still try to cut you off especially like in New York [ __ ] speak quick that's the way it is is I'll literally pause and be like I'm not done and give it a beat right give it a second or two because it reestablishes the frame of like okay I do need to listen so you really have to own your space with people when you're speaking with girls slow the voice down don't [ __ ] speak super quick take your time because what will happen is the girls are going to go "Wow this guy he actually like when he says something he means it he's deliberate with his speech and that doesn't mean you can't talk quicker and whatnot because I'm talking faster right now but have intention and I'm punching you with the words right i'm sending the words to you i'm not sending them here most people go like this they go "Yeah I don't." They throw away the words well you know I don't know no shoot them to you where are you going you know what I mean where are you going i'm I'm shooting the words to you where are you going so get out here and what happens is especially with a lot of introverts there's they're so here instead of focusing on the other person if you focus on the other people if you focus on the other person if you find something about them that's interesting then you'll be able to speak to them with intention so it's very important so to wrap it up if you have issues with your voice if you have a lisp right it's [ __ ] fixable when I was 6 years old I couldn't pronounce certain words legitimately i couldn't even say oil dead serious i used to say oi oi so it was like a joke in my family whatever my dad was like working on the car or whatever so I would say is he getting the like literally I'd [ __ ] stutter so they took me to like a speech pathologist and the speech pathologist was like oh he'll work it out whatever you know so my mom kind of worked with me so I don't want to hear excuses if I have a lisp or I stutter you work through it [ __ ] work through it a lot of people that stutter the reason why they stutter the fact is is because they think what they're going to say people are going to make fun of right so it makes them nervous i've known people that have overcome stutters lisp and being gay no I'm kidding so anyway I'm going to wrap it up but deliberate get a voice coach if you need it when you're talking to girls slow it the [ __ ] down own your space own what you're saying and here's the deal if you believe that what you say is super [ __ ] important other people will too all right lesson four dressing like a G i actually wanted to put lesson three and lesson four together so if you're a bit disappointed with the previous lesson me just saying learn how to fight because like I said this is a no [ __ ] course that's the truth you want the body language of a G go learn how to fight you're going to have the body language of a [ __ ] G simple but I actually want to put these two together because dressing like a G and body language it all kind of ties in like it doesn't matter what you wear if you haven't got the correct swag and if you do have the right body language it doesn't really matter what you wear either it's amazing we're not we're not females we're men so what I'm wearing now this is a [ __ ] $6 shirt but I have it open because I got a [ __ ] my chest is built cuz I'm a G and I wear it how I want and I walk into a room with my chest out just like what and I sit down and everyone just looks at who the [ __ ] that guy it's not an expensive shirt now if I had a if I had a Gucci tag I was I was walking around all meek and [ __ ] would it make a difference really no you don't need to spend money on designer clothes the number one fashion adi piece of fashion advice I can give you is to go to the [ __ ] gym get built you're built you don't need fashion that fashion is just a way to to shortcut that [ __ ] so dressing like a G and body language and G are actually extremely linked yeah you do need some expensive clothes yeah you need some loud pieces etc but even then I mean this shirt can be considered loud the loud pieces once again down to how you carry it if you wear a loud shirt and you don't and you don't and you look uncomfortable and it doesn't work you got to pull it off you're attracting attention just like a peacock peacock gets those feathers out it's like "Yeah look at me." It's exactly the same thing so the mindset and the body language are actually a lot more important than the clothes you wear i mean am I going to tell you how to dress not particularly i think you can go out there and find your own sense of style the most important way of looking at it is how do you feel when you wear those clothes you know and that is down to the mindset and the body language more than anything else you do not need to spend stupid money on clothes i have stupid money clothes but I also have stupid money but I wouldn't need them to get laid really and I'm telling you the truth women don't actually give a [ __ ] about many of the things that money provides even having a Lamborghini women don't care women don't care about cars you're going to impress 10-year-old boys who they're the only people who are wowed by it girls are impressed that you're a man enough with enough ambition to be able to afford a Lamborghini but they don't care about the Lamborghini itself there's not a single female alive who will sit there and go "I don't like this guy i don't like the way he carries himself i don't like how he thinks i don't like how he talks but he's wearing a Gucci t-shirt so I'm going to [ __ ] him anyway." That's never going to happen it's all about everything else the clothes you wear really are unless they're totally awful really ain't going to make too big a difference so how to dress like a G is a very short lesson you can find your own sense of style it's all about how you feel when you wear the clothes yeah obviously there's some basic things we can go over in fact I don't even have any fashion rules the only fashion rule I have to give is never ever ever wear flip flops they're never cool they're a non-combative footwear you can't even run in them i I don't know maybe people say to me "Oh you're obsessed with I've been in a few I've had my fair share of street altercations i live in in mafia ridden countries etc but footwear why are you even going to wear footwear you couldn't even run in like imagine like a car is coming at you you can't even [ __ ] run like why why would you limit yourself to that point on top of that since when are men's feet hot or attractive on any level like no chick wants to see your [ __ ] dirty feet put your feet away put some shoes on don't wear flip flops as long as you don't wear flip flops ever there's no excuse to ever wear them if you don't do that you really can't [ __ ] up too bad you know wear what you got to wear but if you go to the gym you get in good physical shape you can put on pretty much anything it's all about how you carry yourself it's about your body language about how you think the clothes really really don't make too big a difference i didn't want this whole course to be about [ __ ] girls because [ __ ] girls is actually a a very minor it takes very little effort if you achieve everything else a lot of these game courses and courses trying to teach you how to get girls focus purely on how to get the girl and that's the biggest mistake if you read Roo's book or all this [ __ ] it's like go and get the girl and go talk to her this way and this is game no that's all [ __ ] if you focus on everything else I'm telling you about girls are absolutely an added bonus if you have your money right if you talk with conviction if you're a man of stature if you are uh going through life with ambition if you are big and strong and well trained and you walk through life with confidence you're not going to need any gain like the girls are going to sense it and you're going to have girls i I don't have to go out of my way to get laid ever girls message me and they don't message me if I message them or if I go say hello to them they certainly reply i've never struggled with females in my life ever because I've never focused on females i focused on everything else that made me high value and the women were an added bonus they're the they're the they're the salt on the popcorn they're not the popcorn itself so I don't really want to talk about women too much but even when we look at it from how to dress like a G perspective what perfect fashion will achieve you is it will achieve you 10 seconds imagine you go to the store and you buy the big the best Armani Gucci suit 10 grand 15 grand i've got a load of them i've got 15 grand suits on my Instagram you can check it out i've got a picture of me in a 15 grand suit a girl might look at you and she'll think "Oh yeah okay." She might think you're hot or whatever whatever you go over to her and you say hello because she liked what you were wearing you've bought yourself 10 seconds of interest if that for 15 grand you've bought yourself 10 seconds of interest and in those 10 seconds if you're boring or you don't make her laugh or she doesn't like what you say she doesn't give a [ __ ] about what you're wearing anymore that's it it's done you bought yourself 10 seconds of interest 15 grand is it worth it absolutely not you can go over there in anything and it's more about what you say and how you carry yourself than it is about what you're actually wearing so to think that if I wear this and do this I'm going to get girls is absolutely a fallacy that's not true i'm not going to tell you it's true like I said this course is no [ __ ] it really doesn't matter too much what you wear if you're the man you're supposed to be so say how to dress like a G well I wouldn't even worry about that too much what you need to worry about first is the mindset secondly is the body language when you achieve those two things the rest really isn't too complicated how to dress well you can wear whatever the [ __ ] you want because if your mindset's right and your body language is right you can wear whatever the [ __ ] you want i can put on a bin bag and walk in the club i'm still a [ __ ] man it doesn't matter what I wear i can wear the [ __ ] cheapest shittiest clothes and walk in the club i'm still the [ __ ] man i'm still the man because I've decided I'm the [ __ ] man i've been to hell and back to get my world titles i know I'm the [ __ ] man so it doesn't matter what I wear and people will sense that about me even my brother sometimes me and my brother disagree on very little but even my brother says "You don't even brush your hair you don't even you don't you don't you don't put any effort." He goes "You're about to go on a date you're not even changing your t-shirt she wore that to the gym i was like "I don't give a [ __ ] i don't care cuz I'm the [ __ ] man i'm go beat this [ __ ] i'm going turn up in my [ __ ] Lambo i'm going to tell her how great I am and she ain't going to give a [ __ ] what my t-shirt is i don't need to brush my [ __ ] hair my hair's mess i don't care i don't brush it ever why would I brush my hair i don't need to i get out the shower when it's wet." And I go like this boom that's my hairstyle and it's done i don't have to put any effort into my physical appearance because everything about me is is is more than a physical appearance i transcend physical appearances and if you do the first two lessons correctly you will once again transcend physical appearances you don't need to go through [ __ ] walking along aisles saying "How this Gucci t-shirt will this get me laid?" No Gucci t-shirts getting you laid bro it's never going to happen it's about who you are as a person the clothes just cover up your dick for a little while till she wants to get it out you ain't got to worry about it too much so how to dress like a G is actually completely down to you that's your personal style you can make any decision you want to make but don't wear flip flops one and two if you do the first two lessons correctly it doesn't matter what style you really choose you're going to do you're going to do all right in fact I hate to contradict myself but we're doing this entire course without any kind of edits without any kind of cuts there's no second takes this is just pure truth there is another rule besides no flip-flops so that's one rule this is the second rule if you are going to spend a lot of money don't spend it in like Foot Locker or some [ __ ] foot Locker is the only place you can go and spend $2,000 and still look broke don't dress like a [ __ ] street teenager you know just wear some normal ass I mean I'm telling you guys to to you know make your own decisions i'm assuming you're not complete morons don't be morons put on some normal clothes you know and and and you'll be fine don't go Foot Locker and think "Oh I bought these these trainers and girls don't give a [ __ ] about that dumb shit." You can go there and you can spend very little and because of my stature because of how I am because of how I'm built because of my body because of how I train I could spend $10 on clothes and look better than any of you [ __ ] and $1,000 on clothes and that's the point I'm trying to make so how to dress like a G is to do lesson one and lesson two get your mindset and get your body language correct and then you ain't got to worry for [ __ ] what [ __ ] label is on your t-shirt that's absolutely the truth so let's talk about the mindset behind making money so years and years and years ago I had a poverty mindset and by that a I didn't have any money but that's not the important part the important part was that I thought it must be super hard to make money so if you think something and I'm not going to get all newagy on you but if you think something and you say it out loud you start to believe it and what you believe then you start to act on it and then those actions become habits and then your habits wind up becoming your [ __ ] life right so I used to say it's so [ __ ] hard to make money like what the [ __ ] why why can't I make money why is it so hard what is the deal this is [ __ ] I'm just am bad with business I'm bad with making money that's what it is some people are born good with making money and other people just don't have it this is [ __ ] but it is what it said this out loud for years and guess what didn't make any money and hit a point of me being so [ __ ] broke that I was literally homeless a lot of you guys know the story i was literally homeless on food stamps and where you're like you hit such a low you're like "All right I have to try something different cuz clearly whatever the [ __ ] I'm doing is not working." And so what happened was I met this mentor and how I met him I'm going to talk about this later but how I met him um in and of itself is just taking action you know and seeing someone of means and going up to them being humble and being like "Hi just have to ask you like what do you do like how do you how do you have this Lamborghini or how do you have this whatever like what do you do?" And they'll tell you "I'm a Wall Street broker i'm a doctor i'm an online business." Whatever oh that's interesting right getting rich is not complicated it's not easy but it's not complicated you basically look at what someone else is doing and then [ __ ] do it right all of this course a lot of this course honestly could be chocked up to like common sense but common sense isn't so common anymore right you know what I mean like we're living in an era where like common sense [ __ ] is is [ __ ] you know people are like "Wow this is [ __ ] mind it's mind-blowing." But when it comes to money people do get up you know they get caught up because they believe they have self-limiting beliefs they have family that have told them certain things all rich people got lucky or money's evil money is bad money won't make you happy it's all [ __ ] [ __ ] um if you're a miserable person you get money you'll probably still be miserable but at least you'll be miserable on a yacht so you're not going to be as miserable if you're completely broke um but the mindset behind that so I had this poverty mindset so when it switched because I had the mentor who explained to me he goes "The reason why you haven't made money is because you think it's hard to make money you have to change that and think of it as no it's easy to make money." I'm like "Well that's not necessarily true though that it's easy to make money." He goes "Not necessarily but you've got to at least get your mind thinking positively because what will happen is your subconscious will start working on how to actually make money even when you're asleep and shit." That's why if you've ever woken up in the middle of the night and you're like "I have a great idea." Cuz your subconscious is working on on figuring it out figuring out how to get this no different than with women if you're like "It's impossible to get a nine it's impossible can't get a nine it's never going to happen i'm just not the guy who gets nines d you're never going to have a nine." If you're like "You know what all [ __ ] women love me beautiful women want this dick beautiful women want to be with me not this [ __ ] not that one with me." and you actually believe it then you're putting that energy out into the world and I'm not trying to be weird with newagy [ __ ] but energy is a very [ __ ] real thing right so you're putting that energy out into the world and guess what miraculously which is actually you taking action things will start happening in your life so I took uh good things so I took that mentor's advice i started going you know what i need to I do I haven't been negative about money in the sense of like why the [ __ ] don't I have any like to a level of anger and frustration i literally punched my apartment wall one time this was before I was like completely [ __ ] homeless literally punched the wall cuz I was so [ __ ] angry cuz I don't come for money no one on the other side of my family has any [ __ ] money there's no rich uncle who left me money i wish I did but it didn't happen so I switched the mindset to you know what it's not hard to make money money is is neutral money is not emotional right if a piece of money has no emotions it goes to whoever does something to get it right and it's very simple this is literally this simple you want to get rich it's literally this simple find out what people want and then [ __ ] get it for them it is literally that simple so for example this course you bought this course why because you wanted information that I have that Andrew has that you don't have so we supply the information and you paid it's literally an exchange people over complicate this [ __ ] like "Well I need to I need to in uh invent the next [ __ ] Facebook or the next Google." [ __ ] all that unless you're a genius and you literally are a coder and developer and you came up with a brilliant [ __ ] idea [ __ ] all the complicated [ __ ] [ __ ] all the like becoming the next the next the next [ __ ] that literally look at what works right so you're like "Well McQueen I know you sell a lot of courses you make a [ __ ] ton of money from selling courses hm i could create a course i could sell it online i could be traveling the world while making money duplicate it duplicate what someone else is doing literally duplicate it so in the next video I'll talk a little more about this how to get rich i know that's why you bought this course you're sitting here thinking "I want to be rich how do I do it?" I'm going to tell you exactly how you get rich but you may not like what I'm going to say to you but it's the [ __ ] truth there is no easy way to get rich and I'll tell you why the nature of money this is once again something else I understood understood at a very young age the difference between you and me is very little except I had a head start on you well you were 18 acting like a dumbass i was 18 getting [ __ ] done so I've had a head start so in from 18 to 28 I amassed my millions but it's not too late for anybody listen the nature of how to get rich is because of the nature is is very difficult because of the nature of money money is not something you can earn or make people talk about making money earning money money is something you must convince out of the hands of somebody else money belongs to someone else you have to convince them to give it to you that's why making money is difficult because if money is something you could make it wouldn't be difficult if money is something you could earn it still wouldn't be that difficult you really have to convince other people to give you the money and that's the hard part because when you understand that understand that reality then you have to sit there and decide okay I have to convince this person to give me money how do I get as much money from that person as possible that's what you need to focus on how do you make yourself so high value that they'll pay enough for your service regardless of what your service is or who you are as a person because there's a beautiful woman out there who gives okay there's a service she gives a [ __ ] but even then there's beautiful women out there who give nothing and still require and still get given money by guys because they're high value because they have something they have beauty they have something the man wants you have to discover what is it that I have other people are going to want that's the first thing and secondly how can I get them to give me a lot of money for it that's the basis of it so let's go into it in more detail how to get rich is as follows you need to understand in fact you need to get pen and [ __ ] and paper for you to write this down i'm going to struggle to get rich you are absolutely going to struggle it's going to be very very difficult i did on my podcast with CNQ I told a story about uh when I was really at my brokeest and how I ate the same meal every day for about nine months and I called it flavor because it had no flavor and it was basically uh rice i used to buy a 10 kilo or 20 kilo bag of rice for like $20 it was rice it was kidney beans because I read the back of the cans and they had the most protein for the because you get cans of kidney beans for like 9p like 10 American cents back then so 10 cents they had more protein than meat i divided it all up for the value for the money spent i got the most possible protein from kidney beans than I did even meat because I'm anti-vegetarian I don't like the idea of vegetarianism i think it's a disconnect from reality humans have always eaten meat we always will to start pretending that's bad or wrong is is some something a bit wrong up here so I'm an anti-vearian i bought the cheapest possible meat because I refused to eat a meal without meat in it but really my protein was coming from kidney beans so I had rice kidney beans the cheapest possible frozen meat and then just for greens the cheapest thing I could buy was frozen peas and I ate that every single day three meals a day for nine months because it allowed me to feed myself for a month on about 90 or $100 for a month me and my brother two full grown men in combat training eating four or 5 thousand calories a day we ate piles of this flavor had no flavor a8 i said this on the CMQ podcast and this is when back then the reason I had so little money is because I was spending all of my money trying different businesses because you are going to struggle to get rich and you are going to fail over and over and over again all of these people say it tai Lopez Grant Cardone they all say the same thing you have to be ready for failure blah blah blah people go "Yeah I get it." No you don't get it you have to be ready to [ __ ] up because you're going to [ __ ] up because there's no magical formula if you try your first ever business and you make money with your first ever business you're probably going to [ __ ] that up anyway because you don't have any experience with losing money you need to fail to succeed and I know it's [ __ ] cringe i hate to say the same [ __ ] everyone else says but it's absolutely true what I'm going to do in this part of the video is I'm going to put in a clip of something I recorded in my Hateful Tape series telling you a story of one of my failed business attempts so you can listen to that as well and you can enjoy listening to me [ __ ] up because I [ __ ] up plenty of times before I discovered a few things that started to work so whenever I'm in Slovakia or Hungary I drink these because the first time I came to Slovakia I had one at a petrol station and they're like a a drink with chunks of aloe vera in it this must have been about 9 10 years ago and now I've seen these a few times in corner shops and stuff but back then nowhere in England had drinks with aloe vera in it so I was only like 21 22 and obviously I was broke as a joke and I want to get rich so I thought [ __ ] it i'm going to import these drinks and I'm going to sell them in England and I'm going to soul supplier and I'm going to get rich so I found a contact in Hungary who could provide them to me for like I don't know how much they were 38p or something i wanted to sell them for about a pound so then I started contacting all the supertores i was watching Dragonstead about getting distribution i thought this is hard so I emailed Morrison email started emailing them every day saying I some revolutionary new health drink that was uh guaranteed with all these [ __ ] results da da and I promised them 100% markup on it so I told them they'd buy it for 50p so I'd make 12p per bottle and they'd sell it for a pound 100% markup made like I was a real company i'm 22 right away all these people eventually I get an email back from Tesco saying uh cuz everyone ignores you because everyone's trying to get their stuff into superto they completely ignore you got an email back from Tesco saying I'm away from my uh as you know I've now left the business and my replacement is Mr chris Chris something is coming in to replace me so I waited a couple days and I emailed Chris and said "Hi Chris we need to speak urgently your predecessor and I were one step away from achieving distribution." Pretending I'd spoken to the previous guy who left who never responded to me ever so then Chris emails me like "Oh okay uh you better come down then." So it was in Chzon Hartford the Tesco head office and I saw a normal job back then so I arranged a meeting at like 5:30 finished work an hour early walk into Tesco [ __ ] head office in my Matalan suit with four or five bottles of this [ __ ] uh which I brought in a backpack sat down there let him test it all gave my pitch about health benefits 100% bonus all this bollocks he gave me a piece of paper saying how Tesco accept distribution saying like uh it needs to come X amount of bottles per crate X amount of crates per container like just all this expensive distribution [ __ ] so anyway he said he'd get back to me so I [ __ ] leave there excited as [ __ ] call up my guy hungry says "I need it in this many bottles per crate this many crates per container i need to be able to deliver this many containers per [ __ ] week to Tesco stores London all this bollocks da da da da my man in Hungary goes "Okay I can make this happen it's going to cost this much." Blah blah blah so I'm waiting chris emails me and says "Uh we need to talk about your drink are you free to come in again?" I was like "Yeah of course." Anyway in the meantime the guy from Hungary says "It's going to take me six months to turn around preparing your distribution." I said "Oh no it can't be six months." No no tesco want it now tesco want it now he goes "Well I need some money to begin doing this it's going to cost some money so you need to pay me some money." He want like two grand and I had no money i like I had my month's wages was about 1,600 quid came the next day so I remember borrowing £500 and my month's wages and sending it to Hungary two grand the day before my meeting my big meeting with Tesco so this guy could begin [ __ ] pissing around with crates taking my last 100 pound to last me the month now I'm 500 quid in debt as well filling up with petrol putting on my Matalan suit walking in there sitting down with this Chris guy who was fat as [ __ ] i don't know what of course he was in charge of choosing the food fat [ __ ] and he's literally the meeting lasted 30 seconds he said "I'm sorry that my predecessor gave you the impression we were going to stock your product personally I find it repulsive." And that was it that was the end of my aloe vera dream he never emailed me back again none of the other superstores ever emailed me i told I kept emailing "We've got different flavors." Wasn't interested completely blanked me everyone blanked me the Hungarian guy took grand took two grand of my money and I was more poor than ever so now when I drive through the continent in my Lambo I enjoy an aloe vera drink personally I find it repulsive i remember s I remember sitting there thinking in my head that was unnecessarily rude he was unnecessarily rude to me because he thought he was important i'm the fat dude who chooses Tesco's food cut bet he ain't got a [ __ ] Lambo i might you know what i might go scroll through my email and [ __ ] find it somewhere in the depths and send him a picture of me outside my Lambo drinking an aloe vera drink surrounded by aloe vera surrounded by aloe vera drink a big booty hoe absolutely you're going to struggle to make money so the first thing is this when we're talking about mindset talk about being pissed off you don't have money talking about uh believing you can do it all those things are essentially important the reason we did the first video in fact if you were going to do if you if you watch this entire series once that's fine but you need to watch the first video at least 20 times because it's the mindset that's going to allow you to get anywhere else so imagine you're starting from zero now you've now adopted my mindset you've now started to learn how to fight to get your body language right even now even those two small things makes you a higher value person let me tell you something you can go into a job and they're offering 20,000 a year keep the numbers simple if you've implemented the lessons I've given you in the first and second video correctly and you sit there and say "Listen I'm the best employee you are ever going to have." In fact this is a [ __ ] true story i'm saying it like I'm giving you an example this is a true story when I was working sales jobs I used to walk in there as arrogant as a [ __ ] because if you run a company and you're going to hire someone to to make you money to work for you and sell your product you don't want some [ __ ] guys like "Well I'll try my best." No i was as arrogant as a [ __ ] i' I'd walk into a sales job I'd sit down and say "Okay before we continue we need to talk about pay because I'm worth more than the money you're offering." I'm going to explain to you why but basically I'm the best employee you will ever have i'm guaranteeing you I will smash any sales record set by anyone else in that room i will smash it in fact I will smash it to a point where I don't even want a basic wage i want to be commission only i want three times the commission that you're paying because I don't take a basic and I'm going to make more money than anyone else has ever made you were gonna pay me exorbitant thought sums of money i'd sit there and say that to the MD and the managing director would sit there and go "Who the [ __ ] is this cocky son of a bitch?" But then he sit there thinking "Well if he's so sure he's going to make so much money he's going to make me a lot of money." So they sit there and they test you they say "Well well why are you so sure of yourself?" I say "Cuz I'm the best i'm the best salesman there's ever been it doesn't matter what it is i can sell ice to an esmo i'm the best salesman there's ever been and I'm going to sell more product than anyone else has ever possibly sold and so if you hire me you need to be prepared to pay me huge sums of money you need to speak to payroll and make sure they're prepared to spend 20 or 30,000 a month in wages it has to come to me and I want it on time i don't want a basic i want my commission i want it once a month i I want you to make sure you have the facility to pay me 20 or 30,000 in one transfer at a time so you check that before you consider about hiring me i'd sit there and I'd say this [ __ ] i never failed a job interview never i never failed a job interview how do you get rich i got the best jobs i walked into jobs where you needed a university degree i didn't have a university degree i say "Well I didn't have a university degree." Or they didn't even ask me that i sit there and go "Before we start I don't have a degree i know you see you need a degree for this post but instead of spending four years in college I spent those four years learning how to sell so I don't have a degree." And they'd sit there and go "Okay this [ __ ] he knows this shit." I didn't need a degree i don't need [ __ ] college i don't need university i don't need nothing because I had the first the lessons I taught you in number one the first video and lessons I taught you in number two i had the body language of a [ __ ] winner i had the mindset of a [ __ ] winner and they wanted a [ __ ] winner on the team how do you get rich well [ __ ] It doesn't matter if you Yeah you're going to end up eventually getting your own company but I didn't get my own company till I was 25 for a long time I worked normal jobs but I worked sales jobs because sales jobs allowed you to make un unlimited money so I worked sales initially but it doesn't matter if it's your own company doesn't matter if it's working for someone else it's down to your body language it's down to your mindset absolutely that's how you get rich yeah you're going to [ __ ] up sometimes so some of the jobs I talk all this [ __ ] i'd get the job and I [ __ ] and I couldn't sell as much as the other guys i started off and I because I didn't know the product i'm Mr [ __ ] big bollocks and then I I couldn't sell as much as the other guys and they take me in and they say "Okay yeah you sold some product." Yeah but you know you didn't quite hit target this month and then then the MD part of them was kind of like "Haha [ __ ] you're not as smart as you thought." But I just sit there and say "Yeah yeah it's my first month i'm still learning but my promises have not have not changed i'm a man of my word and I absolutely guarantee you I'm going to smash this sales target." And I just stick there and stick to my [ __ ] word and I'd repeat the same [ __ ] over and over again you know what those managing directors of those companies are probably sitting there going "This [ __ ] is delusional he's a little bit delusional but but he keeps trying he makes he makes the phone calls he's trying his best." People would rather have someone who's too confident with delusion than someone who's living in firmly in the real world oh well this is going to be hard because I don't know the product yet but I'm hoping once I learn the product my sales will go up no managing director wants to hear that [ __ ] [ __ ] that garbage i'm gonna [ __ ] beat the record i'm gonna be the best there's ever been you just got to give me a little bit more time to learn i'm the badass i'm the best person here what's funny now is that I probably have more money than any of the MMDs ever had because I [ __ ] meant what I said i said that [ __ ] i [ __ ] meant it i don't give a [ __ ] i meant it this is not an act i'm telling you how to do this and you're sitting thinking "Okay I have to act this way." It's not a [ __ ] act you have to believe it believe that [ __ ] how do you get rich for real believe that you can do anything it takes to get paid my business card i'm gonna like I said we're doing this entire series without any cuts or any takes so I'm gonna get my business card stay right here i want to show you something when I show them my business card everyone laughs at it thinks it's some kind of [ __ ] joke my business card is not a [ __ ] joke my business card is real so you look on business card it says Andrew Tate millionaire and allaround nice guy and on the back it says I'll tell you a very quick story on the back it says this is a quote of my dad's my unmatched perspicacity coupled with sheer into fatigue ability makes me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor uh that's a quote of my father's that he pulled out in fact because we got time because you're sitting here learning how to be a G let me tell you the story about a real [ __ ] G so I was with uh I was in Detroit Michigan 3 in the morning in a gas station with my dad when uh these Mexicans ran in to rob the store they didn't have guns which is extremely surprising for America they had bats and knives they start smashing the store up whatever they get a little bit of money from the till whatever whatever i'm standing in the store i'm standing there with my dad they leave my dad says "Stay here son." And walks out so I guess he was checking if they were still outside i don't I My father was an interesting character i don't know what maybe he was going to fight i don't really know what his genuine intention was i was too young to understand it but I heard them attack him so they were obviously still outside he got attacked anyway uh the police turn up seven or eight minutes later my dad is is badly damaged he they've been hit with the bat and they they cut his face and he's bleeding everywhere but he didn't go down he didn't get knocked out in the end in fact they ran away because he had one of them one of them that has a per because they caught him in fact I'm going to try and find the picture for this video because my dad had a picture of it uh had a permanent scar cuz my dad took a chunk out of his cheek with his teeth [ __ ] ruthless [ __ ] anyway the police officer turns up and goes asks my dad what happened my dad said "I went out there to check it was okay for my son to leave and they attacked me and I I [ __ ] bit this guy's face off and I [ __ ] this guy up and then they all ran off and yeah I've been cut and they hit me with the bat and the police officer goes "What's your job?" to my dad my dad was a big guy the police officer was a bit like "What's your job?" My dad said "I'm a chess player." And the police officer said "Well maybe you should have been something else as in you should have been a cop or you should have been a bodyguard or something." And my dad replied this quote my dad said "My unmatched perspacity coupled with sheer indefatic ability makes me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor." That's how my father spoke that's just how he spoke through life so he was a [ __ ] crazy guy to be around but that quote what he's saying is "My unmatched perspacity my ability to perceive things coupled with sheer infatigability my ability to not become fatigued I don't become tired makes me a feared opponent in any realm of human endeavor." So that was my dad's way of saying to the police officer "Fuck you you think chess is [ __ ] i can do chess and I can whoop these guys ass i can do anything that's that's how my father spoke that's a very quick story back to my business card i've put that on there in homage to the big G but in the back it says I specialize in the following and you'll see a whole list of tasks a whole bunch of stuff on there that I specialize in you can read it pause the video if you want you can read each one so wars fought modeling exposure assassinations plotted revolution started the list goes on and on tigers tamed helicopter hire when people read this they go "Andrew you're full of shit." I'm not full of [ __ ] i'm a [ __ ] G the point is if you're going to pay me enough money I'll get it done that's always been my mindset how what's the key to becoming rich well first if you're ready to pay me there's nothing I will not do sits here saying "Revolution started." People sit there and laugh if someone's going to transfer me a billion American dollars I guarantee I'll start a [ __ ] revolution i guarantee it if you're ready to pay me my fee maybe my fee is too much for you or maybe you think I overpriced myself whatever but if you're ready to pay me the fee I say I want and you're going to pay it to me I'll get it done pay me first I'll get it done if you want a rocket on Mars no problem pay me i'll set a price 3.5 billion American you give me 3.5 billion American dollars I will get a rocket on the moon one way or a [ __ ] another i don't care if hire someone else to do it i don't care if [ __ ] learn how to do it myself i don't give a [ __ ] if I have to come [ __ ] contact some aliens with my [ __ ] iPhone WhatsApp them say "Look I need help moving something to Mars." I don't care what it takes if you're going to pay me I'm going to [ __ ] do it because if I say I'm going to do something I'm going to do it and that's the point of my card there's nothing I cannot do for a fee that's the kind of person you need to be what's the key being rich people need to know you as a fixer they got to think you know what this is a guy who can get [ __ ] done back in my sales career and I quit sales when I became I'm actually four-time world champion when I became I was working up until the point I was world champion because there isn't actually as much money in fighting as people think when I became one time world champion I retired but I was working in sales up to the age of 25 when you become good at sales and you get reputation as a good salesman you can never be unemployed and it's amazing how that reputation spreads i had job offers weekly weekly I have people I previously worked with who've become manager and want to get their figures up call me trying to get me back people who previously worked with who'd moved to new companies and were putting a team together and wanted good salesmen on their team would call me i was getting calls constantly Tate come move for this we can sell this tate come sell that tate come sell this because I was the guy i was the go-to guy to sell product we have to sell product we have to get our figures up who do you know who can get it done well this Tate guy I worked with him before he's [ __ ] crazy he sells [ __ ] that's who I was and when I say "What's the key to getting rich?" So back then I mean I was taking home I don't know 10,000 a month or something like to me now that doesn't even cover my [ __ ] car servicing and petrol but to me then that was good money you know in the real world that's good money so how did I how what's the key to getting rich because to most people to even you watching 10,000 a month makes you rich that's rich to me now it's not because everything's scalable and your perspective changes now 10,000 a month would leave me very poor but back then it was it was a lot of money to me so even then I consider myself rich what was the key to getting rich the lessons I taught you in the first and second [ __ ] video the way I thought the way I spoke the way I carried myself being a serer saying [ __ ] and making it [ __ ] come true like magic that's the key to [ __ ] getting rich every single lesson you're going to go through in this course is going to [ __ ] come back to the same things your [ __ ] view of this world the way you view the world i view the world and I genuinely believe I'm the baddest [ __ ] on the planet and everyone who calls me arrogant is not nearly as successful as me so [ __ ] them i don't care i'm the best i am the best and when I sat there let me tell you something when I did end up breaking those sales records every other [ __ ] in that company there's a lot who couldn't stand me but some of the other sales guys they'd be like "You know what i have to give you respect you've come in here you just you talk [ __ ] you said you're going to be the best you didn't even want a basic wage and here you are you just beat the record i have to hats off to you you're you're crazy." I'm the [ __ ] man that's how you got to be as a person it's how you have to be as a person so when people talk about be prepared to fail I think a lot of that is because people get put off by failure you know failure is one of those things that's going to it's going to hit you and it's going to stop you wanting to come back and try again that's that's what really the being prepared to fail is all about and that's why the fighting is so important as well because when you go and start will want to fight you're going to get your [ __ ] ass kicked and it's going to hurt and you're going to feel like a [ __ ] but you have to get used to just getting over that you know you got to get over it and get up and carry on anyway that's why that's such an important facet of the G mindset along with everything else I taught you the first four lessons of the mindset but those things together I'm telling you if you get those things right everything I'm saying to you is going to start to make sense the key to getting rich doesn't have to be owning your own business i know I know that's very unpopular to say owning your own business is fantastic but in a lot of cases owning your own business is more work than a normal job people think "I'm going to own my own business and then I'll be free to do whatever I want." No if you're owning your own business you're not free to do [ __ ] because you're owning your own business you have more [ __ ] stress than if you have a normal job when you have a normal job you go home it turns off you get your own business it never turns off so it's not really that clearcut and I'm not the going to be the guy who sits there and says "If you ever have a job you're never going to be rich." That's [ __ ] too you can go get the right job and the correct job and you can end up being a very rich individual there's CEOs of Kelloggs you think he he doesn't own Kelloggs think he ain't rich he's [ __ ] rich he's fine what I'm saying to you right now is that to make yourself feel more rich to make more money than you currently make if you doubled your income right now you'd be nowhere near my income nowhere near but you'd feel rich because you've been living for a certain amount of time on a certain income how do you double your income instantly you double your income instantly by [ __ ] implementing my mindset and going out there and either changing your job or going back into your boss and saying "You know what i'm going to do a better job than I've ever done before i'm about to do X Y and Zed i'm about to change this for the company i'm going to do all this i'm gonna do that for a month and you're gonna see how valuable I am and then I want this much money and if your boss goes "No," say fine I'll find someone who will say "Okay I'm going to do it anyway i'm gonna do it all and then we can talk again." If you're still not interested I don't have to find other employment sit there revolutionize [ __ ] mix [ __ ] up do some [ __ ] crazy [ __ ] and you'll make more money you want to feel rich you can feel more rich right now the [ __ ] number one piece of advice I give to everybody they go "Oh what what job what industry?" Sales find a [ __ ] sales job sit there refuse the basic wage demand double commission tell them you're going to be the best he's ever been and become and because you've implemented the lessons in in the first video when you say [ __ ] it comes true be that guy who succeeds then you'll feel [ __ ] rich it's all about mindset it's all about how to become rich is a mindset it's not about trying to get hold of money it's about viewing the world in a way where you are such a high value individual that things float to you people were desperate to employ me i didn't have to ask for jobs they were desperate to employ me even now when I started my company when I first started my company I went to I need an investment from a guy i went to him and I said "Look I want $200,000." When I go to someone and say "I need 200 grand we're going to make some money." They want to give me the money i don't have to convince them to give me the money they want to give me the [ __ ] money they're like "Okay yeah okay 200 okay yeah yeah let's do it." Because they knew who I was as a person so the key to getting a job the key to being paid more the key to getting investments the key to it's all the [ __ ] same it's a it's a mindset and it's a personality it's who you are as a person if you implement that at [ __ ] the the G mindset you get that [ __ ] right you're going to have anything you want then you want to start a business you want you need an opportunity or an investment to do it people are going to [ __ ] give it to you because you have a reputation of someone who does not fail become someone who does not fail and you will easily become someone who is rich all right how to get rich for real part two if you listen to the lessons in part one you're now making more money than you've ever made before because your time is now more valuable you're a different person you demand more respect you command more respect and even if you're only making a little bit more money than you were previously making you're still making more money so now you start to feel a little bit rich now there's a whole bunch of people online who know more about the ins and outs of [ __ ] ISAs and all that [ __ ] than me there's a whole bunch of people out there who will give you a million different tips and tricks to do really how to get your money up i'm not interested in any of that crap i'm just going to tell you the truth of how to really make money there's two things you need to establish first you cannot save yourself rich and I say this because a lot of people are interested in being so frugal and they think that that's the key to to wealth being frugal is not the key to wealth being frugal will never make you rich if you're making $5,000 a month and you manage to live your entire life spending zero dollars you pay no money for food you pay zero money to get to and from work you live somewhere for free and you never need clothes ever and you save 100% of your $5,000 a month you will still never ever be rich it will still take you 12 years to buy my car it's not going to happen the only way and that's one of my cars let alone the rest the only way you're ever going to get rich is if you substantially increase your income this is the first thing the second thing is if your income is linked directly to your time there's only so much time in the day the first part of this lesson the first lesson was make your time more valuable make those hours you spend working generate you more that's fine unless you can do that exponentially to a crazy sum unless you can get to some crazy figure in reality you're going to need other people doing things for you or you need something happening without your input so that your time isn't linked to your money if your time is linked to your money you're going to run out of time you're not going to make enough money so people often say okay I understand that so passive income there's no such thing as passive income i hear the word passive income a lot and there's really not very much which is truly passive income people say "Oh like property is passive income." No it isn't you think renting you think buying a house and renting a house is passive income then you've absolutely never done it renting a house means you got to find tenants put tenants in there make sure they pay you on time the washing machine's broken you got to go around there and fix that oh the rent's late you have to go around there and argue with the tenant then you have to end up kicking the tenant out then you have to try and find another one the whole apartment's trash they've damaged the walls renting an apartment is a full-time [ __ ] job and the return on it really isn't that much you mean you you buy an apartment for 300,000 you rent it for like a th000 a month it really ain't all that i mean people love people especially old school people talk about property property property property was the way you became wealthy you bought a house when you're young and you became wealthy but nowadays it's not how it's done plus property is very very slow okay you buy a house now you're going to be rich or well off when you've paid it off when you're 55 60 who gives a [ __ ] about being rich when you're 60 who cares i would rather be rich now and broke when I'm 60 than broke now and rich then i'd happily be broke when I'm 60 i'll [ __ ] rock up in Thailand with a bottle of whiskey and a couple prostitutes and jizz five times a day i don't give a [ __ ] i'm old i don't need clothes or a nice car nothing who cares you're 60 no one's interested in your Lambo when you're 60 they're interested in your Lambo when you're young and hung like me so the point is property and passive income and all this garbage is out the window you really need to find a way to increase your income so I'm going to tell you how I did it i'm not going to tell you everything i'm going to tell you the basics what I understood was this i can't link my time to my money and I need to find a way to increase my income so what you need to do is and it doesn't matter what it is it doesn't matter if it's mowing grass it doesn't matter if it's something else it doesn't matter if it's [ __ ] typing documents it doesn't matter if it's translating it doesn't matter what it is what you need to do is find a service people will pay for and you need to find someone who will do it cheaper than the price being offered that's it it really is that simple so let me I'll give you a really quick example imagine someone offered you $20 to do something that's fine instead of doing it and wasting an hour of your time find someone who will do it for $19 pay them $19 and it's done this is why I I said in the first video you don't have to own your own business to end up rich you don't and you can feel very rich if you double your wages or you do a sales job that's fine but you will inevitably at a certain income point probably end up owning your own business by doing what I'm describing right here you get people to do things for you um you're the middleman as such and this just evolves into your own business even some of the people on Twitter I noticed they're they're pushing like CBD oil and all this stuff and they're being affiliates that's fine but if I was them I'd have an affiliate link underneath the affiliate link which is not just my Twitter page but I'd put it out to other influential Twitter pages so instead of getting okay imagine imagine imagine you have a Twitter and you're an affiliate you're selling something for 50% that's absolutely fine i would do that but what I'd also do is get another link that I got 25% of and 25% to someone else and I'd be pushing that out you make a lot more money with other people doing the work for you if you understand so you can be an affiliate and you can get affiliates underneath you doesn't matter even if you're the second or the third person down the line you can still get people below you doesn't matter what business we're talking about here someone's prepared to pay for something that's fine find something that needs doing find a price they're prepared to pay and find somebody who's going to do it for less than the price now if it's a huge job you need to make a good markup but if it's small jobs a dollar is fine they're paying 20 and it takes 30 minutes and you know someone who will do it for 19 you just need to suck up them jobs as many as you can get someone else who's going to do more get another person who do it for 19 get more jobs more jobs more jobs do such a make sure quality control make sure the jobs are done properly you're collecting a dollar a dollar a dollar for doing nothing this is the key to making money i a long time ago knew a guy who was a street pimp and he said "Pimping is the only real passive income." I was like "Why?" He goes "Because I sit here and they are doing the work i don't have to do anything then they just give me the money." He goes "Another business where that is done." But basically that is essentially all businesses you're pimping out someone else's time for your cash so it doesn't matter what it is you can go on Craigslist you can go on anything find something people are prepared to pay for find someone saying "Look I need some garbage collected and moved or whatever $100 for the day whatever." And then just call around your friends find your 15-year-old brother find someone who will do it for $90 collect 10 bucks that's a task for you pull it off once and your world will change you'll do it once you go "Wow." Okay then you just have to find a way to scale it because the problem with linking your time to your money is there's no scalability when you when you destroy that link you can scale things so I personally generate business i generate quite a lot of money and it's not linked to my time i have a lot of people out there making money and I make some money there's people I pay more than I make for example there's there's there's a particular setup I have where I have three people making let's say 10,000 a month i'm only making three grand from it but it's their full-time job and I literally do nothing so to them they're getting paid more than me but I don't do anything i keep all of my time and if you can set up enough little things like this three grand a month isn't much but you know it's it's the electricity bill whatever and it all adds up and then you come up with a new idea a new idea a new idea most people out there do not want to be as entrepreneurial as you will have to be most people do not want the responsibility of trying to find money on their own what they want is guaranteed money that's what they want they don't want the hard part of finding the job negotiating the price they don't want that they just want somebody to say "Do this i'll give you this." Most people are robots so you have to take advantage of that and it doesn't matter if it's cutting grass it doesn't matter if it's something online doesn't matter what it is if you can take advantage of that you will find a way to make money start this on a very small scale start this on a small scale so your time's no longer linked to your money and you're making $500 extra a month small scale bang get an affiliate marketing telling you something now telling you something now you can go on Twitter right now with a thousand followers you can do a deal with a company to get an affiliate saying if I get any product sold through this link I get X percent get that done then all you have to do is convince people with more followers than you people more important than you are to tweet your link and they're the ones doing all the work they're the ones with all the influence they're the ones with all the [ __ ] followers and you're still getting paid off of their accounts like there's a million things you can do all it's down to is once I said before your mindset your body language knowing people people respecting you if you approach someone with an opportunity they respect it if you do these kind of things and you know people who like making money then you're going to be fine but this is also another real key thing when I say know people who like making money most people the people they hang around with are [ __ ] most people hang around with people uninterested in money before I had money all I talked about was money when I'd sit around with my friends it'd be like "Oh hi how you been?" "Yeah yeah okay Ben how how can I make money how are you making money how do we make money right now we're in this coffee shop okay how much is the coffee do you think they're making money in the shop do you think they're losing money why Why is the waitress ugly they'd make more money than a pretty waitress why don't they have a garden outside it's it's sunny outside do they sell cake no if I had a coffee shop next door and I sold cake and I had a garden I had a pretty waitress would I make more money than them these are the things that would just go through my mind when I was just sitting having coffee you're sitting there having coffee scrolling up and down on Instagram looking at people with better lives than you unhappy i was sitting there thinking "Okay maybe I need to [ __ ] take this place out of business and then I can buy it off them for pennies when they're [ __ ] broke." You got to think about these things if you think about money and the people you're around only think about money and you understand that if you can take on any job any task and you can outsource it for less than you're being paid you're going to make money this is what my business card's all about tigers tamed well you can't tame a tiger no but you know what I can do i can tell you a price you can send me the money and I can find someone who will tame a tiger for less than you sent me that's what I can [ __ ] do so that's why I make sure my price is right see you're like "Oh you can't tame tigers i can tame a tiger send me a million dollars i'll tame a tiger try me and I'll keep half a million i'll give half million to some [ __ ] African dude who grew up around tigers he's happy i'm happy bang i ain't going to [ __ ] see a tiger i'm busy getting a blowjob." That's how you get rich that is the key that's the second component key one make yourself high value increase your income with whatever you're currently doing that's fine number two delink your time and your money find a way to become a middleman find a way to become a fixer outsource things and if you start doing that correctly I'm telling you money starts to come in from there what you want to do with the money is up to you some people are investing in cryptocurrencies some people are investing in property whatever whatever whatever it's completely up to you but a lot of these online how to make money blogs are are garbage they tell you if you don't drink if you don't drink a Starbucks once a week and save it in 15 years you'll have 30 grand like who gives a [ __ ] like what what is 30 grand me and CMQ blow 30 grand in a weekend like what what can you buy a house with 30 grand can you buy a car with 30 grand well yeah but is it a life-changing car no like it's not even a lot of money it's all garbage i could tell you a few trips for tricks for frugality but it ain't going to change your life i mean all in all it ain't going to change your life you can't save yourself rich you need to increase your income so the task from this video is as follows watch all the other videos again get the mindset right get the body language right etc so when you approach someone and say "Hey I've got a job if you do this I can pay you this much money." Get them to agree find someone else find the job first find someone who goes "I need this doing." Fine no problem find someone else to do it make sure they're getting paid less than you're getting paid keep the middle money and that's how you'll end up starting your first business very few people start their first business by just quitting their job and starting a company online and go in there and starting a company it doesn't work that way it's it's far more organic than that it grows slowly like you know what i can outsource this to him outsource this to him i have to quality control their work to make sure it's done properly all of a sudden I'm basically their boss oh we got lots of work coming in they're working full-time blah blah blah blah blah and before you know you have a company that's how it goes so if you're sitting there going "Well what what things can I do?" Google online there's a million different little [ __ ] jobs on Craigslist or whatever find someone to do it if you have a little brother make his stupid ass do it find a way and one way or another that's going to grow into a company and then you'll be rich how to get hot girls now this is a subject I could talk about for a very long time but I want you to understand some basic concepts to to the pimp game basic concepts to the realities between men and women there are some factors you can control and there are a lot of factors you cannot control when it comes to getting hot women now if you don't know who I am you don't know my qualifications i don't want to brag about how many women I've [ __ ] whatever whatever you know I'm rolling in the highest possible echelons all those Instagram models you're seeing with like 100,000 followers and you're sitting there thinking "Who's that guy who finally who gets to actually [ __ ] her in the night?" Well it's me that's who so I'm rolling in the highest possible echelons of female quality and I know the game inside out so first let's discuss the things that you cannot affect one of the largest and least discussed factors to to to attracting females is an uncontrollable thing which is timing timing has a huge huge effect on how a female is going to react to you if you go up to a let's say imagine you're in a nightclub you're chilling in a nightclub you go up to a girl you want to talk to her now if that girl has just been bought flowers for dinner by her boyfriend before she goes to the club she's not very likely to talk to you if she just caught her boyfriend cheating she's more likely to talk to you do you understand that things that happened pre prior to your meeting have a massive influence on how she's going to react to your approach is she happy in her relationship is she not is her is is is she staying at her friend's house tonight is she not is she on her period is she not dumb [ __ ] like these are things that can completely affect if your girl knows she's getting picked up by her boyfriend at the end of the night why is she going to talk to you if she knows her boyfriend's out of town she's supposed to be staying with her friends and her boyfriend's pissed her off because he ain't text her in a few days she's a lot more likely to reply to you these are things that have nothing to do with your approach my point is that every single female has a window where they are susceptible to your language and there's windows where they're completely closed my chicks who I have on lock the multiple females I have on lock I I am very confident that if they go to a club or they go out and a man tries to talk to them there's nothing that man can say that's going to get her to be interested in it there's nothing because they're closed they are closed for business it's like having a [ __ ] storefront the store is closed you can't go inside whereas if the store is open you can go inside and try and negotiate a deal so you need to understand that timing has a huge factor to play with every single female this is very important so we know timing has a huge effect timing has a huge effect there's been girls who I've hit up they've kind of half replied to me never really got anywhere hit them up again six months later when I see their big booty pop up again on my Facebook feed we end up at dinner and I say "The first time I tried to talk to you you were you know we we we didn't get anywhere." And she's like "Yeah I was going through some stuff you know I had some problems at home." Basically she wasn't open for business the first time I tried to speak to her i'm obviously the kind of man she likes because right now we're on a date she obviously wants to dick but at the time she wasn't susceptible to my approach because timing has a huge factor to play with females and this is why they say it's a numbers game it's not a numbers game because you're definitely going to fail in fact I'll be confident enough to say I mean I know all these [ __ ] game books say otherwise if a [ __ ] is open for business and I make an approach I have an 80% success rate i will [ __ ] 80 to 90% of the females who I attempt to sleep with at least probably even higher i'll say 100 i don't give a [ __ ] if I know if a girl's single and I say hello and she feels like talking that day it's game over i don't fail ever sooner or later they're naked so when they say it's a numbers game it's not because you must fail when you're getting girls that's [ __ ] game talk for amateurs the reason it's a numbers game is because you don't really know who's open for business and who isn't i can give you a few tips and and visual cues to decide who's open for business who isn't [ __ ] that garbage it's better just to stick it as a numbers game you try they're not open for business next you try they're not open for business next you try she is susceptible to your game and then you move on so this is one of the first things you understand about females is that women there are a lot of factors you can't control and a lot of women are not open for business now during this period where they're not open for business do not blast your chances by making her lose respect for you so if you message a girl she doesn't reply fine you want her to reply you want to play with her tits i get it wait at least three months before you try again give it a chance for her [ __ ] to blow over because let me tell you something if she has two messages or three messages from you a year maybe two years later when she's [ __ ] sitting at home and she's lonely and you say "Let's go have some fun," she'll reply to you that's fine but when she has a thousand messages and you message her even if she feels like replying she's going to scroll up and see that creepy [ __ ] and be like "Fuck this this guy's a weirdo." So don't blast your chances when the [ __ ] door is closed and the shop isn't open for business don't [ __ ] bang on that door too hard because all you're going to do is make her lose respect for you and you're never going to get laid so you can't be doing that [ __ ] if someone's not susceptible to your approach leave it and leave it a generous period of time approach other women come back when there's been a period of time in which things might have changed things haven't changed in two days things haven't changed in three hours stop hitting them up you look like a [ __ ] so this is a very important thing this is the first thing second thing you need to understand about getting hot women is that women are never without attention you don't have to make a girl like you that's easy you have to make a girl like you more than she likes the other guys who are trying to make her like them do you understand the difference you have to win as a girl she just has to as a girl if you're a girl you have to make a guy like you guy [ __ ] you easy as a man you have to make the girl like you most because there's always other dudes attempting to make her like them that's something else you need to understand and what I was saying to you before about body language about mindset etc one of the keys to doing this is to make the small gestures that you go through more valuable than the small gestures they go through exactly the same as I was talking about job interviews the things you do have to be more valuable how to get rich well my time is worth more so you must pay me more it's exactly the same with females so for example imagine you are trying to talk to a girl she may she'll never admit it but she's talking to two or three other dudes she'll never admit it until she's exclusively yours there's other guys hitting up her phone those guy one of those guys sends her flowers you don't send her flowers now on paper he's winning he went through it he sent her flowers he did something for her he thought of her you did nothing but if you're such a high value man that you're busy and you're getting your [ __ ] done you're getting paid and you say to her "Yeah I've been busy today i'll message you later." And she respects you enough to look at those words and go "Okay I know he's busy he has things going on." Then you win anyway you ain't got to send the flowers it's not about the flowers it's about your time being more valuable it's about putting a price on yourself which is higher than this guy's so you don't have to go through the same [ __ ] he went through to try and prove a point you can prove a point with a message i got [ __ ] going down but I'm going to call you at seven that's worth more because your time's worth more than [ __ ] Mr nobody send flowers do you understand where I'm coming from it's not about the gesture itself it's about how you value yourself this is why in every video I keep going back to the G mindset and the body language these things are extremely important with females i don't try too hard with girls i really don't try too hard i will talk to them a little bit i'll make it clear that I'm not as big an [ __ ] as people think I am and then I'll try and progress to a meeting if that meeting doesn't seem to materialize then the game's over for me i'm not sitting here trying to chase a meeting out of some [ __ ] that's not who I am as a person because you need to understand that half of the people on this planet 50% of all people alive are females so that woman you think is so special that one you really want she's so special she ain't special bro she ain't special get that [ __ ] out your head straight away because the more special you think she is the more you're going to [ __ ] up when you're talking to her she ain't special she takes a [ __ ] in the morning like everyone else it's a [ __ ] human organism who cares there's girls prettier than her around maybe you ain't got their phone numbers but they exist so you got to go out and get them so don't be trying too hard now the reason I get away with such little work is because I put such a high price tag on myself i am a four-time kickboxing world champion multi-millionaire so even even any female no matter how beautiful knows I'm never going to be the guy hitting her up constantly i'm not gonna be the guy she can call and I'll always answer i'm not gonna be the dude who will give her lifts to work she knows I got [ __ ] going on so remember what I was saying earlier to you about how I've never struggled with females because I never focused on the females these other game books and Roo and all these idiots here's how you This is the woman get the woman get the woman forget the [ __ ] forget her forget all the chicks worry about yourself get yourself straight and when your own [ __ ] straight got yourself together females are an added bonus it's much easier to focus on yourself and get yourself high level and then start getting females than it is to forget about yourself spend all your time day game running around the mall doing a thousand approaches trying to pick up a real [ __ ] slug who will bang anyone and getting laid [ __ ] that garbage all the game you've read before is [ __ ] it's absolute [ __ ] and you're gonna see why it's [ __ ] in in one of the upcoming videos about how to keep hot girls especially you're gonna see why it's [ __ ] but it's [ __ ] because if you go up to a thousand girls you get five phone numbers and one might [ __ ] you yeah I'm sure that's absolutely true but so you're going to spend your life instead of becoming rich instead of becoming strong instead of becoming smart you're just going to [ __ ] run around a mall approaching girls day game it's [ __ ] it's garbage it's for children all that [ __ ] is for children i focused on myself and that's how I've managed to attain the highest quality females and also not attain retain which is another thing we're going to do a separate video because retaining females is completely different to obtaining females so we're talking about the factors that you cannot control in terms of females we talked about the timing how some stores are closed talked about how you have to make her like you more than the other guys and sometimes that's difficult because let me tell you something she might be talking to a real G if she's talking to me you're going to struggle to make her like you more that's the truth i have more tangible assets more physical financial and mental assets plus I know the game sometimes you're outclassed it's how it goes sometimes you're just outclassed that's how it goes it's another thing you can't really control but what you can control in those situations is that you don't make her lose respect for you and don't kill your chance for the future by being a little beggy begging for attention [ __ ] keep your honor about you because if you if you're going to lose the game there's two ways to lose it with honor and without honor you're going to lose soon as you sense you're going to lose as soon as you detect this girl I'm not going to get her then you can either lose her by begging hoping for that little tiny chance and losing all your respect or just thinking you know what I'm going to try again in eight months [ __ ] this [ __ ] i'll get someone else so we all know what the correct decision is don't be [ __ ] so desperate for a girl that you just lose all your honor and self-respect because then you're never going to get her ever and that's some real dumb [ __ ] so I want you to understand when we start talking about women there's a whole bunch of factors you cannot control now there are some factors you can control obviously who you are as a person like I said lesson one lesson two etc if you watching this course you need to watch the first lesson a hundred times if you understand the first lesson the first video I made in this course if you understand it and implement it correctly everything I'm saying to you right now is all you already know you already know it what I'm saying now you're like "Well yeah of course." Because of the four lessons I gave you in the first course so if you understand them correctly I don't really have too much to say but I'm just reiterating some points for you so when it comes to approaching hot girls you have to understand this some are open for business some are closed for business next what can you do besides the factors that you cannot control what the factors you can control well body language is one of them obviously clothes we've we've discussed all this but really when it comes to approaching females game as a whole is something I don't like i don't like the idea of it because it's [ __ ] it really is [ __ ] i cannot sit here and tell you how to act even if I told you to have the exact same mannerisms as me and say the exact same things I would say they work for me but they will not work for you because we're individuals we're absolutely individuals for the same reason when you learn to fight you learn the basics of it but if I were to say mimic my movements millimeter for millimeter I won't get hit you will get hit because we're in different bodies since we're different people so I can't sit here and say "Do this do this do this." Anyone who tries to tell you that what they're doing is they're trying to oversimplify an extremely complicated situation in an attempt to get paid because every single female you approach is going to be different every single scenario when you're in is going to be different every restaurant you sit in is going to be different you're different to me the mood she's in is going to be different the weather is going to be [ __ ] different maybe it's raining maybe it's sunny everything has a small part to play so for me to sit here and say "If you do this and then you do this and then you do this you're going to get laid is the kind of [ __ ] people package up trying to make it a complicated situation seem simple to get money." Getting laid is not simple the only thing you can do if you want to retain especially in a future video retain as well as obtain hot women is be yourself you cannot project an act for any considerable period of time that's not possible the only way you can be anything for a considerable period of time is to be yourself so maybe you're a [ __ ] person yeah fine maybe but you have to absolutely and artly be yourself now there are some things which are ironclad beneficial when it comes to getting females you can be yourself and be a confident version of yourself as opposed to a meek version of yourself confidence is always attractive because men were built to lead like we said earlier men were built for combat so confidence is something you need everyone already knows this [ __ ] and confidence doesn't have to be sitting there and bragging confidence is little things when you pick the girl up where are we going i know where we're going not where do you want to go she doesn't want to hear that [ __ ] she doesn't want to make decisions females don't want to think they want to be led down a rabbit hole of entertainment they want to be entertained they don't want to think they don't want to sit there and have to think about it they'll say "Yeah we're going here." Even if you get there and it's [ __ ] because I don't like it or say "Yeah well I do." Stick to your [ __ ] guns so confidence is obviously the first thing but you know that [ __ ] already just be confident about who you are and what you say doesn't mean you have to be an [ __ ] you haven't got to be an [ __ ] in fact a lot of people confuse the two a lot of people go "Girls like assholes." No girls like confidence but nowadays only [ __ ] have confidence if you're the rare select guy who's not an [ __ ] and also supremely confident you're definitely gonna [ __ ] you haven't got to be an [ __ ] it's the confidence they're attracted to not the [ __ ] qualities so yeah you absolutely have to be yourself you have to be a confident version of yourself but we've already talked about this in lesson one believe you can do anything you're about to go on a date with Megan Fox are you intimidated no because you're the [ __ ] man and you're going to [ __ ] her same night after taking her to the worst restaurant in town because you can do anything because you're a [ __ ] G that's how I think i don't even brush my hair i don't even shave i rock up in [ __ ] clothes and wear them for two days i don't give a [ __ ] turn up hi start talking [ __ ] before you know it she's naked cuz I know my skills i know I'm the G you know you're the G you ain't got nothing to worry about you can be yourself and you can be a completely different person to me personalitywise and still be a G you can say completely different things and still be successful you can have different mannerisms and different techniques or whatever [ __ ] and still be successful if you've implemented the first lessons correctly so how to get hot girls part two so we've discussed how there's a lot of factors you can't control that's why it's a numbers game the solution to all the factors you can't control is numbers game approach approach approach approach never blow out by be by losing your honor if they're not open for business [ __ ] them off let's assume they are open for business you've gone up to them you said hello whatever whatever told you you have to be yourself because you ain't going to be anyone else for any long period of time you're now a G you're now a high value individual so being yourself is going to be valuable let me tell you something imagine I did a course on how to play piano but we never actually played piano we just sat here and talked about pianos how pianos work the basic rules of piano the infrastructure of pianos the different types of keys there are blah blah blah when you sit in front of piano are you going to be able to play the piano no you're not and it's the same with girls i can only give you so much advice the only way you're going to get good at getting girls is to start getting girls the reason I'm the best is because I've I've been through I don't even know how many women i don't know how many approaches is I don't know how many situations i don't know how many turnarounds how many [ __ ] tests i've been through it all because I speak to lots and lots and lots of females so the easiest way to get good with females is to speak to lots and lots and lots of females the easiest actionable piece of advice I can get you to get good at getting girls is you need to be speaking to one or two new girls a day now the coward's way is Facebook and Instagram the every hot girl their inbox is already full of people it's very difficult to differentiate yourself from everyone else in that inbox so that's not really the best way you need to be interacting with two to three new females a day they haven't got to be that hot they can be sixes sevens whatever you need to be interacting with them one way or another if you interact with two or three new females a day every day for three months you're going to have a different quality of game than before you did so you're going to have the girls who are rude to you you're going have the girls who who want to talk you're going to go through it all but let me give you some basic tips and tricks the number one thing as a man you cannot do in any situation when it comes to females or anything else is compromise your honor compromise your respect so for me personally I'll tell you how I do it let's say I get a lot of girls from social media nowadays because my Instagram page is is off the chain so you can tell by my Instagram page if you know me I'm a fun guy to be with females only want fun it's all females care about is fun so my Instagram's a little bit intimidating so I removed the intimidation factor i talked to them for a little bit within an within an hour or two I'm saying WhatsApp now when I ask for their WhatsApp it's it's because it's more personal than an Instagram page instagram's for everybody whatsapp's for people you really know so it's an escalation point and either they agree and give it to me or at this point there's some points of contention now if there are some points of contention some small ones I don't mind it they might say "Why do you want my WhatsApp?" And I'll say "Oh my Instagram's slow on my phone." I make up some [ __ ] excuse because they want me to have some [ __ ] excuse they know my excuse is [ __ ] they know why I want it i say "My Instagram's slow." If they say "Oh if they content again oh but I don't like to give my number out." I'll just say "Okay no problem." That's it and then they'll go "Okay so what you doing today thanks that's the conversation over." That's it done they lost their chance with me by not giving me their number when I demanded it that's how I roll let me tell you something leave them on scene leave them ignored she wants you more than ever you can come back to her three months later if you come back to her a week later she's going to give you attitude you can't do that you got to leave it for such a long period of time she genuinely believes she was forgotten about this is the abundance mentality i'm talking to so many females if I ask for your number after an hour and you're not going to give it to me I don't want to talk to you anymore because you're too much [ __ ] work for me i ain't got time for that [ __ ] because I'm going to [ __ ] someone today anyway i'm at that level so I don't really have to play your [ __ ] game if they give me the WhatsApp that's an escalation within another hour or two hours I'm looking to arrange a date i am not the guy who sits there talking away that's how you end up in the friend zone i'm not that guy let's go for coffee oh really so soon and then I'll say something like "Well you think you can get to know someone over messages." And they'll be like "Well no one says yes to that." Go "No but you know we just started talking." So well you're not going to ever know me and I'm never going to know you you seem too complicated for me to work out over WhatsApp that's what I'll say and they'll either go "Okay." and we'll sort out a date or they'll go some other [ __ ] oh well you know we I just gave it if it's more [ __ ] I say "Okay no problem." And ignore them it's how it is because I deal with so many females for me it's a numbers game i have so many females on my phone I can't possibly reply fast enough so I don't give a [ __ ] i don't care if you're a 10 you want to play these games with me i'm not playing them i don't play the games because you can never sacrifice your honor so any female I've ever interacted with even ones I haven't [ __ ] could not go through our the history of our conversations and find anything that compromises me as a man keep that in mind when you're writing [ __ ] that's really important because women only want to [ __ ] guys they respect they don't want to [ __ ] any other guy they don't want to [ __ ] handsome guys they don't want to [ __ ] They want to [ __ ] guys they respect and if you sacrifice your respect then she doesn't want to [ __ ] you so why do you want to meet her you got always keep the end goal in mind why do you want to go on a date with this girl is it to be her friend is it to buy her dinner is it to listen to this her stories about her [ __ ] other [ __ ] friends or is it to [ __ ] her because if it's to [ __ ] her then you need to keep that in mind and not sacrifice your respect if you have to sacrifice your respect to get her to come on a date then she ain't going to [ __ ] you anyway so why do you want the date you don't so don't forget the [ __ ] end goal so to learn you have to learn about yourself more than you have to learn about women if you want to get good women you have to know what your strengths and what your weaknesses are i know my strengths i know my weaknesses there's very few but I know I know what they are you have to learn about yourself you want to learn about women imagine I told you to go out into the world and find the best apple you could find if you uh if you come back and you've been and you've had one or two apples you've looked at one or two apples and you tell me which one's the best is it the best apple in the world well no because you've only [ __ ] around with a couple apples so what do you know what a good apple is they might all be bad apples you don't know is that the biggest juiciest apple you could possibly find no whereas if you went out there and you [ __ ] around with millions of apples and I said "S give me the best apple you could find." You're very likely to know a lot about apples and be able to identify an apple that's better than the rest and women are exactly the same women are exactly the same a lot of people want to learn game not to [ __ ] endless numbers of women a lot of them want to learn game to get a woman who respects them and looks after them and wants and is worth marrying well if that's the case game is more important than ever [ __ ] bunch of women is fun yeah but if you want a real wife quality woman you need to tear through a whole bunch of women to find a good woman i know what a good woman is because I [ __ ] so many girls i've had so many apples i can identify a good apple straight away because I've had so many if I've only had three or four apples what the [ __ ] do I know about apples you don't know [ __ ] and that's why game's so important nowadays because if you stand any chance of even surviving in a traditional relationship man woman marriage whatever you still need to have game you still need to play the field you still need to [ __ ] a whole bunch of girls before you identify what a good apple is i never get played by girls because I can identify the kind of girls who are going to try and play me people say "Oh you got money." And how do you know they don't just want you for their money because I'm not a [ __ ] [ __ ] because I've [ __ ] a thousand gold diggers and a thousand girls who aren't gold diggers and I can spot it from a mile off i can smell it you think I'm [ __ ] stupid because I have experience with apples you got to get experience in this game so the most important thing for how to get hot girls is experience let me tell you a story about a man called Luke the man luke the man worked with my brother in a coffee shop when Tristan was 18 19 in a prep in the airport nowadays when me and Tis Tristan we want to go on a pure G girls mission this is a let me diversify from this story quickly night life in general is [ __ ] night life is boring guys don't care about clubs we don't care about music we don't care about dressing up we don't care about drinking it's all garbage men only go to night life to [ __ ] we want girls if someone were to say to a guy before he went on his night out there is a 0% chance of you getting laid tonight would the man still go most men would say "Oh I don't I don't care then i'm not going to go." That's it was the old school way men used to get girls you know nowadays there's more efficient ways I guess if you want to live on the internet whatever but that's how it was that's what night life was based around [ __ ] came guys try and get the [ __ ] guys come and spend the money d so nowadays when me and Tristan go into a club if my brother goes to me let's loop the man in this club what that means is let's just go up to every girl let's get the numbers or blowout with every chick and leave [ __ ] the drinks [ __ ] the music [ __ ] the fun when I had no money I never used to go to club so I didn't have money to waste and I was also training so I didn't have much time to waste club would close at three i'd walk in there at 2 o'clock when everyone was already drunk i'd identify the five hottest girls in the club i'd go up to them and talk some [ __ ] to all of them walk away with two phone numbers and I'd go home that was my night life done that was their [ __ ] 35 minutes night life over next day trying to get a date so that's what we used to call Luke the man in the club because the only reason we'd go out is to get girls so most men would go out hang around with their friends drink beer build up their confidence all that garbage when you're a G you don't need none of that [ __ ] in to the point out hit four or five nightclubs in a row leave with [ __ ] five or six phone numbers done hey the girl was particularly receptive then you'd stay in the club trying to take her home at the end of the night but if you you know she's staying with her friends or D and you don't think she's going to [ __ ] you just get the number and leave but there's a few times I turned up at 2:00 sober as a judge by 2:45 and walking out with a [ __ ] because that's how I roll so why do we call this Luke de Manning well Luke the man was one of the pioneers of the game luke the man taught my brother a lot about the game way back when so this is about 11 years ago a brother worked in a coffee shop in an airport one of the guys he worked with was called Luke luke was from the Ivory Coast Republic one of the poorest countries in the world black as night ugly as a [ __ ] broke as a joke working in the coffee shop but no matter the female no matter how ugly old no matter how beautiful no matter what if they'd come up to that counter to get coffee he would lay some game on them say "You're so beautiful baby i will give you a coffee a special coffee from Luke luke the man he used to call himself Luke the man and my brother used to sit there and go "This guy's a [ __ ] joke." Every single girl who tries the same dumb [ __ ] and at the end of giving them their coffee he used to ask for their phone number every girl now 90% of them told him to [ __ ] off 10% he got their number he didn't [ __ ] them every once he'd bang a real ugly one whatever about two months after my brother worked there the guy Luke the man came in one day with a picture of a Hungarian girl who was a [ __ ] 10 like a porn star 10 naked pictures of this girl tristan's like "Who the [ __ ] is she?" He goes "Yeah I looked I spoke to her at the coffee shop." He's like "No way did you get that girl here." Goes "Yeah two days ago I got her here i was at her house last night." Tristan could not believe it like how the [ __ ] this girl's a 10 you're the ugliest brokest black dude I've ever known in my life your teeth aren't even straight how the [ __ ] did you bang her like I'm Luke the man i don't give a [ __ ] i'll go I'll talk to every girl with confidence every girl with confidence i'm mixed race i'm half black half white this is the one thing the brothers have over the white guys black guys don't need money to get laid black guys can be broke with one leg they still get laid because they're confident and they don't give a [ __ ] that's how they are so black guys you got worry but here it is he [ __ ] a 10 out of 10 how many tens have you [ __ ] you're probably sitting there going one two no you've never [ __ ] a 10 my 10 and your 10 are different you've never [ __ ] a 10 but Luke the man has luke the man's [ __ ] a 10 he has less money than you and he's uglier than you and he can barely speak [ __ ] English how cuz he didn't give a [ __ ] cuz Luke the man's a G luke the man has confidence and he'll talk to any [ __ ] that's how you got to be luke the man knows about girls remember that story and how to keep hot girls now this is interesting because when I had my Twitter on Cobra people used to call me out on this people thought I was a liar but let me tell you something i don't lie because I'm a G and my word is iron and there is a level of pimpery you can attain where you can literally have a harim of females i say this to people and people don't believe it and when I say harim of females I mean beautiful women who are loyal only to me talk to no other men who know about all the other women I [ __ ] and still take dick and behave it's almost like the best lawyers become judges you know and the best the best players end up in my position where you have a havarim of females if you go back to the video where I was saying about how to get women I was saying that it's important you be yourself and here's absolutely why to obtain a female can be done with game and rouch and his garbage books and tricks and tips maybe maybe if she's drunk you can pull that off i know a couple of them that kind of half work but I haven't even said them in the video because you know what it's not it's not the key to success however you cannot retain a female for any long period of time with an act you can't pretend to be anyone other than you are forever because that's not it's not just not going to happen game lasts if she's drunk in the bar but who you are is the only thing that's going to keep her around you so when I said it's important you are yourself it's because if you get a 10 out of 10 you don't want to [ __ ] her once you want to [ __ ] her every day and you want to make sure she doesn't [ __ ] anyone else and you want her to give you massages and you want her to look after you you want her to listen to you well then you have to be yourself cuz she ain't going to Who else you going to be me you wish [ __ ] no you got to be yourself so only way you can really retain females over a long period of time is being yourself so this is why I was telling you how important it is to be yourself at the beginning and also make yourself someone worth being in the other videos I was explaining it but how to keep hot women like I said there's a level of pimper you can attain where you can have literally a females but I'm going to tell you the key to this and it's remarkably simple in fact I'm going to link back to one of my other videos I've already made explaining the dynamics between men and women i'm going to explain it again now and I'm go back to the video to go over it again women are biologically programmed to share their man and they're biologically programmed to share their man and you can look at this with scientific evidence because since the dawn of human time 99% of females have reproduced they can track the chromosomes whereas since the dawn of human time only 19% of men have reproduced what that's saying is all the kings and shakes and the best biggest strongest soldiers like Big Daddy Tate had all the [ __ ] and all the other dudes had no [ __ ] there's no other way that could have possibly happened unless one dude had a ton of chicks in fact even nowadays every king every sultan every shake they all have loads of women people are pretending it's not normal it's not normal for a man to want more than one girl absolutely is normal it's absolutely normal for men to have more than one woman this is how we are we're mammals like everything else if you look at a lion's pride if there's five men and five women that's not 10 happy that's not five happy couples no it's one lion with five girlfriends and four lions who don't get [ __ ] unless they beat the best lion in the fight that's how lions work that's how it works so you can't say it's not natural it's absolutely natural and women are biologically programmed to share their man if you're a high value man a girl is happy to share you i'm telling you no I take that back she may not be happy to share you but she'll [ __ ] do it it's kind of like do you want a pedal bike that works every day without problems or do you want a Ferrari that works once a week well most people say "Well yeah I want the Ferrari because when it does work it's worth it." That's what it's like with the women i want big daddy take do I want a guy who's only with me and loyal to me and loves me or do I want Big Daddy Tate once a week when he ain't busy even though I know he's off [ __ ] other girls i'm telling you they will make that choice and they will choose you if you're high value enough and the key to doing this is a few things first dick's got to be on point that's something I have to teach you you better just go [ __ ] a bunch of [ __ ] and you'll learn that's the first thing but second thing you have to be high value all the other lessons I've ever given you but the third and most important key to actually pulling this off is remarkably simple the the dynamic of cheating for a man is is an awfully cowardly one it's quite a cowardly act like I have a girlfriend and I'm [ __ ] another girl and I'm hiding all the messages and I'm lying about where I'm going and I'm sneaking out and all this garbage and and when the girl finds out she thinks you're a [ __ ] she loses respect for you because you were such a little [ __ ] about it do you know how I get away with doing what I do i get away with it by saying to girls "Yeah are you first I [ __ ] him i'm a nice guy till I [ __ ] him." Because until you have sex with a girl you have no control over her you got to [ __ ] her first few weeks you're [ __ ] her [ __ ] her you've been together three months it's the honeymoon period she's madly in love you're [ __ ] her d Where were you last night i was with this girl what what this girl starts going crazy yeah I was with another girl yeah look I'm a full grown man i'm 31 i'm 6'4 i do what I want with my body i put my dick where I want yeah I still love you no I don't love that [ __ ] but I [ __ ] her that's the reality if you want to leave leave but that's what happened and what they'll say is "Why are you saying it like that why are you being rude?" So I'm not being rude you want me to lie to you i don't lie i told you I'd always tell you the truth so I'm not lying i'm not lying i'm telling you the truth so you want me to lie to you from now on and then they sit there and this is what happens one of two things happens they leave but if they leave they never loved you in the first place because if they love you they ain't going nowhere or they sit there and women ain't that stupid they think "Okay I love this man with all my heart and he [ __ ] someone else do I want to go and leave the man I love and try and find a man I don't love who's hopefully not going to cheat who probably will?" Like they start doing the math and they start just asking stupid questions like "Well how do I know you only like me how do I know you don't like her who is she?" All this [ __ ] and you just go shut down it's like "Don't worry about it don't worry about it look don't worry about it you're the one I'm with what happened happened don't worry about it." And ain't going to go anywhere i'm telling you they ain't going to leave dick them right that night it'll be fine they'll be a bit pissed off whatever but it grows into a lifestyle they start to understand that's just who you are as a man my girlfriend says to me she goes "I know I couldn't change you so don't even try." She knows she will say to me tonight "Are you staying with me or or out?" She says "Out but basically are you staying with me or you [ __ ] someone else?" She knows she's a 1 million% loyal to me she talks to no other men and she knows I [ __ ] a whole bunch of women because I am programmed to [ __ ] women i'm not going to apologize for my biology and neither should you you have no reason to apologize for your human biology as a man we are programmed to [ __ ] because we don't get pregnant women get pregnant women have to be selective about who they sleep with because if they got pregnant in the olden days without a man to look after him that's a death sentence you're on the street with no man to look after you the reason virginity was so respected in the olden days is because that's the easiest paternity test in the world the only way you know who the man is if she ain't [ __ ] no one else otherwise you don't know who the [ __ ] baby dad is no one wants to raise a kid that ain't theirs there was no DNA testing back then but man we ain't got to worry about none of that [ __ ] we go [ __ ] who we want run around [ __ ] [ __ ] [ __ ] why do you think people joined the army why do you think the Romans [ __ ] were walking in directions why do you think the the Mongols destroyed Europe for [ __ ] what the [ __ ] else were they doing besides kicking ass and [ __ ] There was no video games back then nothing else to do there's no [ __ ] Breaking Bad to watch they're just [ __ ] girls this is the natural order of men it's just to [ __ ] as many women as we can so you can be the kind of man who either does it and tries to hide it like a little [ __ ] or you can just do it and just say "Yeah sorry." Whatever now I'm not going to lie to you occasionally you're going to lose some girls there's the old girls like "I'm not playing with this." And they run off whatever get a new one gives a [ __ ] but if she truly loves you and that's why it's important you don't implement it straight away give it a few months keep everything on if she truly loves you [ __ ] yeah it happened sorry start off with it was a one-off it happened it was a one-off let her get over that then it kind of happens again and then there's another girlfriend then then then then you know then you're sitting there you're out you're drinking talking about how you're going to play with the titties later you say "You know what i'm going to [ __ ] you i'm going to [ __ ] that other girl i'm going to [ __ ] you together you're going to be sisters you're going to hold hands and you're both going to call me daddy." I'm not doing that i'm not doing that you are doing that i'm not doing that i bet one day you do it she'll say no telling you get her on her back start [ __ ] her start talking about it watch her [ __ ] smile every girl wants to do this [ __ ] man obviously this only works with like highle hoes you can't be saying to a 10 "Come [ __ ] this five." Because that's embarrassing to the 10 but if you have a Barbie doll [ __ ] like I do if you're banging with the best girls in the world every every 10 wants to [ __ ] another 10 girls like that [ __ ] girls are [ __ ] up girls want girls want tits in their mouth just like you do it's normal so if she's bad and the girl you're talking about is bad and there's some alcohol going on and both of them are subservient to you the king and you get your dick out they're getting [ __ ] that's how it goes before you know it you end up with a whole bunch of loyal girlfriends only to you now is it all smiles and rainbows no sometimes the girls argue sometimes they get jealous sometimes they don't get along blah blah blah but they don't leave so who cares sometimes I wake up on my phone well this girl put this picture of you on Instagram and I didn't put this picture and it looks like she's your real girlfriend i'm not your real girlfriend and I just have to read like whatever just a block or shut up or I'll reply like I'll handle it do nothing have a coffee and just chill whatever is Is she leaving me no is she leaving me no i'll [ __ ] her at 8 i'll [ __ ] her at 10:00 i'll hit the club with my bro at 11 it ain't a thing there's a level of pimpery you can attain where you can pull this [ __ ] off and people call my people on Twitter like "You're lying you're lying." Because they couldn't get their [ __ ] head around my mastery they couldn't handle the fact that they can't even get one girl to respect them and I have multiple tens loyal to me for years subservient to me sucking dick whenever I [ __ ] say so if I want to put a threesome together it takes two [ __ ] phone calls anyone who followed my old Twitter knew I went to Copenhagen it's the worst place in the world [ __ ] Copenhagen sucked i made one phone call i had two blonds on a plane never even met each other before you're going to meet at the airport her name's this your name's that buy them [ __ ] priority seats they sat there on the plane drinking vodka so how long you known Andrew turned up few more martinis later bang dickfest that's how I roll you can roll the same remember you're the man who can do anything it's the first tenant of the G mindset you can do anything you [ __ ] want so keep that in mind and you'll get it done as for how to keep hot girls part two we've discussed how to get them discussed how to put your herm together all of this is based on being the [ __ ] man you got to get like to a G level no woman's going to share you with your little [ __ ] why would she share a little [ __ ] if she can go get another little [ __ ] but if you're something she can't get anything else of she'd rather have half of the man than 100% of not the man like I said with the push bike and the Ferrari if Ferraris were everywhere she wouldn't share her Ferrari but there's only one in town she has to share it and she knows so now we're going to go on to like a lot of people ask me "What do you do when your girl does this what do you do when your girl does this?" Like almost like how do you discipline your female i'll tell you how women only give a [ __ ] about one thing attention females exist for attention they start arguments for attention they talk [ __ ] to you for attention everything they do is to get your attention there's always attention so what do you do how do you keep hot women well like I said earlier about getting hot women you can never sacrifice your honor you can't be running around beating girls up in that dumb [ __ ] that's not cool you can't do that on any level what you can do is be ready to cut a hoe off ruthlessly that's got to be your trump card at all times i don't give a [ __ ] if you're a 10 and you cook me breakfast every day we've been together for 5 years and we're madly in love [ __ ] with me too tough it's done now I'm not going to insult you this is what men do men try and insult the girl or get back at her or tell her friends things or show naked pictures of her all that's attention that's all she wants no what you have to do is just say "Okay bye bye." Don't block her because if you block her you have to leave it un leave her leave her unblocked leave her unblocked so she feels like you could message her anytime but you just don't she doesn't understand she's sitting there with her pretty ass going "I've never been with a man who just doesn't give a [ __ ] he just told me to leave and I've actually left and he doesn't message me and he totally ignores me he totally ignores me like I don't exist he saw me in the club and I was dancing on some other guy and I was drinking i was trying to make him jealous and he totally ignored me he like I wasn't there he didn't want to fight the guy nothing he just ignored me like I didn't exist that's how you drive a [ __ ] crazy that is the number one thing a woman who's in love with you can't stand the idea of being absolutely ignored because if she knows you inside out like all the girls I've had to pull this on the thing that the greatest thing about it is they know I'm not lonely they know I'm not sitting at home alone they know I'm [ __ ] someone else so then it's not about me then it's about them losing to other women then they're like "Fuck he's [ __ ] all these other girls he's having fun with those other girls he's taking those other girls to places he used to take me and he doesn't care about me anymore and he's not he's not messaging me." And I tried to make him jealous i put I put my Insta story with some guy and he he doesn't even care doesn't even look at it and like literally I've had girls say to me "We split up and you didn't even check my Insta story once." Like "Why the [ __ ] am I check your I don't give a [ __ ] about you i'm check your Insta story." What the [ __ ] you're putting things on there trying to make me jealous what am I going to look at that for i don't look you don't get zero attention from me my attention is my only weapon as a man because that's all we have we give women attention so they give us sex so if the sex has to end for any reason you don't need my attention anymore that's my currency i'm going to give it to someone who sucks dick and you're not allowed to suck my dick so buy that's how it has to be so how to get hot women because there's going to be times when you and your girl argue that's fine you got to make your point make it quick make it blunt if she gets too fresh just ignore her this is how it's got to be cuz when a girl wants an argument the reason they're so hard to reason with is because women have no shame if they want an argument it doesn't matter how logical you are they just want the argument they don't want a solution so they're just going to keep arguing for the sake of it it doesn't matter how correct you are they want the argument so you can't win so why are you giving her because the argument is attention it's basically like we're coming to your attention wallet your your currency and just taking it out [ __ ] you i'm not playing that cook me dinner i don't want to kick you dinner cook me dinner i don't want to find someone else while I'm out what you're going way no you're not leaving you're not leaving well I need to eat [ __ ] you cooking or I'm leaving let her choose i'm telling you you got to stick to your [ __ ] guns attention is your number one weapon so in this part two that people go "Well you have a harim of girls you got all these girls what do you do when your girl gets fresh to you?" But to be honest with you my girls don't get fresh too much because it's it's almost like it's like the carrot and stick but the stick has to be somewhere they going to know it's there but you don't have to pull it out that often like my dad was strict and people think the idea of a strict dad is he kicks your ass all the time no the idea of a strict dad is he kicks your ass so badly once he never has to kick your ass again like they they know I knew do not [ __ ] with him because I know that the end result and my girls know they've tried it once all of them have and now they sit there and go "I can't push too much because he'll get he'll get the stick off the wall." You only got to do it one or two times and then your threat means something because remember the one of the rules episode one you mean everything you [ __ ] say so if you tell her get the [ __ ] out she's going to start crying and panicking i got nowhere to go as soon as you said it because she's going to like [ __ ] I ain't got nowhere to go maybe she has somewhere to go but she doesn't want to go there who gives a [ __ ] point is she go mean what you say so you haven't got to be constantly disciplining them if you discipline them properly in the first time and the only way you discipline a woman is to ignore her i've had girlfriends I've ignored i had a girl I'll tell you a story whatever i had some girl and I was [ __ ] her for three months whatever she was madly in love with me obviously she got my name tattooed she had king tape tattooed here darkhaired [ __ ] i [ __ ] her with my blonde girl [ __ ] her all over the place [ __ ] all over her and then she wanted to go to the the seaside here in Romania she wanted to go to the seaside beach resort with her friends she's like "Please come please come." I said "I'm busy i ain't got time for that shit." She goes "Oh can I go?" I said "To be honest with you I don't really want you to go i don't like you out partying without me you shouldn't be doing that [ __ ] she's like "Please please please because you're going to go away soon with Vivian." So she knew she's like "Look you're going to go away on holiday with with your other girlfriend can I go away for three days with my friends?" So I kind of reluctantly that's the level my girls literally bargain they're like "Look I know you're going to go [ __ ] her so please can I just go with my friends here?" I was like "Fine whatever." So I let her go day one she's messaging me madly in love with me d I ignored her just as a little punishment little bit for going still ignored her anyway day two I'm in the club with T these [ __ ] walk in me and T start macking on these hoes these Moldovven girls blah blah blah blah this girl does a Instagram story and tags me in Instagram story me and her kissing in the club the girl at the seaside [ __ ] sees that messages me what the [ __ ] starts going mad about this new [ __ ] I just found i'm drunk so I just like read and ignored i don't give a [ __ ] um and then she at the rest of I don't know i got a message from someone else saying she was at the seaside she was trying to like dance with some guy maybe jealous whatever i didn't I didn't check her Insta story i didn't check her Instagram never spoke to her whatever i never spoke to that [ __ ] again i saw her in the club twice both times in the club to try to come up to me and when I say Norah I don't like push her away or something like I'm walking and she comes up to me goes "Andrew Andrew." And it's like it's like it's not there so I just walk straight like like it doesn't like no one said nothing she's a ghost and nothing drives a [ __ ] crazy like being ignored this pretty ass girl has never been ignored before never it's been about four months now and three days ago she messaged me out of nowhere she held on for all these months before she finally collapsed because after she sent me those messages about me with the girl and I left it ignored we never spoke again we never said a word on WhatsApp never said a word nothing then she messaged me how's Tate smiley face four months she gave in because she's like sitting there holding out like all the [ __ ] do go he's going to message me first he's going to message me first i'm too busy getting my dicks up to message you first [ __ ] i don't care cuz there's more of you everywhere there's half the world are women even if I did miss you which I don't cuz I'm too [ __ ] gangster even if I did I just find someone who looks like you i don't give a [ __ ] i'll close my eyes i'll [ __ ] a [ __ ] who looks nothing like you with my eyes closed and pretend it's you i don't I don't care i'm not going to start messaging you oh you you went to the seaside and you dance with a guy i don't give a [ __ ] about those games i ain't playing those games you tried to make me [ __ ] jealous like a basic [ __ ] you got ignored now you're begging for attention she's back in London now saying "Can I come for two days so we can talk [ __ ] is about to fly international come here to talk get [ __ ] basically she wants to [ __ ] suck my dick get [ __ ] and go I love you i made a mistake wbee strength and honor cuz I stick to my [ __ ] word because the only way to discipline a hoe is to ignore their existence if she started dancing with that dude and I was like "What the [ __ ] what you doing master?" She'd be like "Yeah well you were dancing with that girl." And it would just be some [ __ ] argument on WhatsApp some [ __ ] talk and even if we got back together she wouldn't respect me the same because she knows she can annoy me by pretending to be a hoe and like it's it's just it's just a mess it's a mess why do I want to get back with a girl who knows she can bother me by acting like a hoe in a club then she's going to go to the club again they're like like no it's all a mess she now knows the hard way you [ __ ] with Tate you don't even get a message you don't even get acknowledgement you don't get [ __ ] confrontation you get nothing tate just disappears you lose Big Daddy T that's what happens when you [ __ ] with him so don't [ __ ] with him because he'll just go and he'll [ __ ] someone else and some other girl will be in love with his dick and I won't get any of it and I can't stand that [ __ ] no one wants to miss out fomo fear of missing out you got to be on a level of [ __ ] pimpery where these girls know if they're not [ __ ] with you they're missing out that's how you punish females so how to connect with millionaires and billionaires this is my favorite topic to talk about because it can transform your life so way back in the day when I had no [ __ ] money no connections nothing what did I do i looked around at successful people and went up to them and said "What do you do?" Now that sounds simplified right that seems very like okay but that it's actually the implementation in doing it i wrote about this on my blog years ago called the power of who you know was 18 years old i was on a plane i looked over to my left or it was to my right and this older gentleman was reading a political book and I used to really be big into politics thought about going into politics and so I commented on it intelligently and we got to talking we have this great two-hour conversation we get done he gives me his business card he's like "Look me up i was living in Indianapolis he was in Chicago come to find out he was the Chief Supreme Court Justice of Illinois michael J gallagher he's retired now that's literally his name um complete J and a [ __ ] the Supreme Court justice of Illinois i mean you realize the level it's insane so what I did at [ __ ] 18 years old with no money contacted him very politely like the next week hi you know Mr gallagher thank you you know for giving me your business card you mentioned doing lunch i'd love to you know take up that opportunity if you if you have time that's okay very [ __ ] respectful very conscious of their time i'm not sitting on the phone for 30 minutes and uh he's like absolutely come to Chicago let's do this day at this time etc so I would drive three and a half [ __ ] hours to Chicago from Indianapolis and went to lunch with him introduced me to the governor of Illinois who happened to be in the restaurant so you're talking an 18-year-old dumbass who was literally hobnobbing like the governor it's insane so we have lunch and I'd save some i wore like my best suit that I had and everything like very you know proper and uh I remember the bill coming and I said you know I'll get that Mr oh no he's I got it and I remember him kind of smiling thinking like smart of him to [ __ ] offer to pay but I've got it like not a big deal but you want to offer right so it's always respect always respect consular time so anyway we formed this friendship and mentorship and he was influential in getting me a full ride to law school which I passed up um to this day he was probably pissed about it but the point is is like I would have never gotten those opportunities if I wouldn't have actually just opened my mouth when I saw something that we could have common ground on which was this politics book so the thing is with connecting with millionaires and billionaires and I have a million stories about like this type of [ __ ] you have to [ __ ] take the initiative people email me all the time McQueen how do I get a mentor go out and get one mentors are not millionaires aren't sitting on the corner in their [ __ ] Lamborghini going "Hi son do you want some advice?" They're not doing that they're actually living their life they're [ __ ] busy so what you have to do is you have to take the initiative and you might go "Well you know maybe um I'm uh you know I'm just not important enough or they're going to blow me off." And maybe they will so what find another one there are millionaires and billionaires out there who are complete [ __ ] they're like "Fuck off kid." But you go out you find another one where do you find them this is the million-dollar question where do [ __ ] rich men hang out cigar cigar clubs cigar shops um golf courses high-end restaurants high-end lounges but really your big one is the cigar shops dead serious grand Havana room in Beverly Hills was where I used to hang out at 23 24 25 26 and met everyone from Charlie Sheen it doesn't even matter about the celebrities but the business that happened and you can Google it Grand Man Beverly Hills it's a beautiful place the connections you make in those places is mind-blowing now it's a private club how do you get in well I had met another rich guy who said um "Come to the Granavann room i'm a member you can be my guest." And then I got to know him so I could go whenever I want now how did I even meet him and this is the million-doll [ __ ] nugget of gold that you've got to take and you got to figure out your angle i don't know you i don't know your background i don't know anything i don't know where you live what does this rich person not have that I can get them and nine times out of ten I'm telling you it's going to be women right so these rich dudes obviously they could have hookers they don't want hookers some of them like have hookers what they want is they want girls that will hang out who want to be there who are not getting paid and that is how I met a lot of these people so in LA obviously had tons of girls and what I would do is they'd hit me up hey McQueen uh you know we're going to go to whatever we're going to go to this restaurant do you want to bring some girls of course right because I had something they do not have i didn't have money but I had access to women just from like going out you know meeting girls or whatever like hey girls you know I have a friend in town or he's rich dude he's going to buy dinner all right cool they would come and be fun and be cool and they're not hookers and legitimately these rich men love that because the female energy who who doesn't want to be around hot girls when they're eating it's great so that was my angle so what you have to do is is find your angle what do you have access to that a rich person doesn't and generally it's not going to be a monetary thing obviously like it's not like you have a Ferrari they have a Lambo right you probably don't have anything maybe you don't have any money so what do you have well you have knowledge now and I will tell you right now if you use social skills and [ __ ] game to meet women and you have access to women you happen to be out and you always have hot girls with you guarant [ __ ] te the rich dude in the club the rich dude in the restaurant is going to be looking and think "Who the [ __ ] is this?" And they're going to come over and want to meet you right what do you do oh I'm just you know just trying to you know trying to do my thing i'm starting a business or whatever oh this is this is Claudia and this is Tiffany and this is Michelle and you're going to see his eyes light up and he'll probably even ask you like "Are they paying?" Like "No they're not no wow you here let's exchange contact information i have a jet let's fly to Vegas let's fly here sometime just bring some girls." Done so once again it all comes back to [ __ ] everything's driven by [ __ ] but legitimately if you want to connect with millionaires and billionaires you need to find your angle you need to be able to provide value and provide something now a lot of you are probably sitting there going "But I don't have I don't have any value or I don't have any leverage." Make it then make the leverage figure out your angle and then make it happen so I don't know your situation so I can't tell you exactly do this do that but you have to find your angle and then you also need to hang out in places where successful people hang out if you're hanging out at [ __ ] Pizza Hut and at the mall in your Hot Topic or [ __ ] American Eagle if it's even around anymore and you're hanging out in those places you're not going to be meeting millionaires and billionaires go to where the source is even better if you're a super young cat [ __ ] get a job at a golf course as a caddy you want to talk about learning about business be the [ __ ] that carries the golf clubs and listens to the business guys talk all day long because a lot of deals get cut on the golf course get a job at a private airport sweeping the [ __ ] runway whatever that's a great job i had that job years and years ago too get a job at a cigar shop even if it's menial [ __ ] job it will give you access to these people and you're [ __ ] polite and you're cordial you know how to handle yourself and you're not an idiot because you're using all of the knowledge of this course guarantee the opportunity is going to come where you're going to you know I'm sure I have to ask you like what do you what do you do exactly i'm very curious you know I'm a young guy i just would love to get some advice and you know what for even now cuz I'm getting older people do it to me and obviously they're my brand but we want to help if you come at me respectfully then I want to help you i want to provide knowledge i want to see you excel because it's a way of giving back and if they're a truly a good person they want to give back so that's how you connect millionaires and billionaires find your angle get in the places where they [ __ ] hang out i'm telling you you have to do that you cannot sit at home or at [ __ ] Pizza Hut and go I don't know where the millionaires and billionaires are and it doesn't matter where you live you can live in Ohio you could live in the middle of [ __ ] Belgium wherever there are always rich people in those cities and you need to connect with them find out what they do and maybe it's something you want to do too global G lifestyle this is absolutely not really important once you get your life half in order once your money starts coming in there's a few things you have to do and this is something I was ultra paranoid about for a very long time and that is basically in one form or another get off the grid but it's extremely difficult to get off the grid and still live a normal life we live in a digitized society you still need certain things you need an address you need a passport you need a driver's license there's certain things you need so to a degree you're going to be on the grid so when I was sitting there thinking how do I prevent people from [ __ ] with me because that's what's going to happen if you start making exorbitant sums of money you start traveling the world you start [ __ ] a whole bunch of girls you're going to have girls who might come at you after you with a court case you might end up with some police problems you might drive too fast whatever whatever whatever people are going to start to [ __ ] with you quick side note when I had no money I used to think how do all these lawyers make money like who needs a lawyer and as soon as you have a shitload of money you start spending loads of money on lawyers lawyers are like a tax on the rich as soon as you have money you see you're going to end up in court cases for dumb [ __ ] that you never thought you'd end up in court cases for so your life's going to change so for a long time I was sitting there pondering how do I get off the grid i did a few things i put all my mail to a PO box my mail doesn't come to my house so no one knows directly where my address is because that's how police and agencies find you they look where you're signed up for mail to arrive and and they come and they turn up at your door so there's little things you can do like put your mail to a PO box but what I actually found is because we live in a world where it's nearly impossible to get off the grid the best thing to do is to be on as many different grids as possible so when I say that what I mean is you need and this is an absolute essential component you need to have multiple passports you need to have multiple driver's licenses you need to have plenty of copies of these very important documents so that you're not at the mercy and whim of one particular government so I'll give you an example i have four passports i won't name them all but I have a British and an American and two others i have five driver's licenses from five different countries so there's been a point in my life where I got up got on a plane flew to a country went into a driver's school said "How do I get a driver's license?" They said "You need a residence you need a address you need this you need this." And I spent six weeks doing whatever it took starting bank accounts getting residency getting a [ __ ] tenency agreement anything it took to pass that driver's test and get that driver's card because now if I take that card outside of the country the country I'm driving in does not have jurisdiction to affect my driver's license so for example you're driving in England or driving in America let's say you're England i know England you're driving in England you drive too fast the police stop you you give them your English driver's license they take the license well in England if I'm driving too fast and they stop me and I give them a Thai driver's license or an American or a Romanian or an Estonian driver's license they the British government the British state does not have the right to affect that license they cannot take that license from me all they can do is take me to court which is a long process and ban me from driving on their particular roads my license is not affected even if they do ban me from driving on their roads and they ban my Thai license for example I'll just pull out a different license you see I'm now above the law i'm now above the law with speeding same thing with passports i have multiple passports i have the most powerful passports on Earth i can look at country and go do I need a visa well I do with this passport but I don't with this one and this is all something I've consciously gone out of my way to do then when you have multiple driver's licenses and multiple passports and it's something you need to dedicate a year of your life to you to say you know I'm going to spend a year i'm going to go to countries i'm going to do anything it takes to pass the driving test get the driving license get the passport etc because it's extremely important once you've done that you can open up banks in lots of different countries so I have in maybe 11 different countries sums of money sitting in bank accounts all in English internet banking all in English sitting all over the world who the [ __ ] knows what's going to happen do you know what's going to happen america might get invaded my [ __ ] nuclear bomb whatever whatever i don't want to talk conspiracy theories the point is my money is spread out my passports my ability to travel is spread out i've decentralized myself talk about the blockchain i am the blockchain my ability to drive is spread out you can't pin me down and take my license and refuse to allow me to drive a car you can't who you going to speak to you got to speak to six different governments do you know how long that's going to take then you have to prove I I committed an offense bad enough for them to take away the license they don't give a [ __ ] you want to write to Bangkok and tell the ties I was speeding in England you think they give a [ __ ] they don't give a [ __ ] they ain't taking my license away nobody cares because although the world is connected we are not where you're not yet thankfully at a level where everything is completely globally interconnected so what you need to do is go on plenty of different grids decentralize yourself blockchain yourself to the point you have multiple passports multiple bank accounts multiple driver's licenses in plenty of different countries lots of residences lots of nationalities so that you're completely above it all and heaven forbid worst comes to worse police file a warrant for your arrest and block your passport you got five more so who gives a [ __ ] how to travel like a G right this is going to be quick to the point how to travel like a G because what's going to happen is you got your multiple passports you got your multiple driver's licenses you now have an income that's coming in you can go anywhere you want you believe you can do anything you're now the [ __ ] king of the world so you're going to go to a lot of places i've been to 71 countries i've been to places as crazy as Iraq i've been to the most boring standardized places like Thailand blah blah blah i've been everywhere i'm going to tell you a few travel tips these are non-negotiable travel tips so if if I say something and you disagree with me [ __ ] you point one you don't need checking luggage i'm tired of seeing [ __ ] full-g grown men with big ass suitcases chucking checking in luggage you don't need that much [ __ ] as a man you really don't and it doesn't matter how long you go away for it doesn't matter if you go away for two months doesn't matter if you go away for two weeks all hotels have laundry service you're a [ __ ] fullrown man you're not a girl with shoes and designer clothes no one gives a [ __ ] what you really wear you need a check-in bag you need to stay light you need to stay flexible couple pairs of trousers couple shirts couple pairs of shoes some underwear some socks getting washed overnight in your whichever hotel you're staying in in the laundry service if there's a real big issue and you need another t-shirt go buy one for $15 who gives a [ __ ] done toiletries once again you can buy when you get there i don't have toiletries in my checking bag cuz I can't be asked with the [ __ ] TSA security people tearing through my bag i've been away for three months on on half a backpack i still look good every day it's fine get yourself washed like you would at home you do not need big se You don't need big cases of luggage luggage slows you down luggage is weight you do not need you're a full- grown man check-in luggage only if you struggle to complete this if you struggle if you're about to go on holiday and you're struggling to fit everything you really need in in your check-in luggage then you do not understand what a man really needs you need to get more [ __ ] brazen and more barren with your with your necessities in life toiletries you can buy when you land you're already wearing one set of clothes when you take off couple other sets of clothes couple pairs of shoes done do not check in a bag because one firstly just don't be a coward and I said so don't check in a bag and two that [ __ ] slows you down man the time you wait in the [ __ ] line to check it in then when you land you got to wait for the luggage to come out i'm in and out i'm in and out of airports when you fly as often as me you got to learn to be in and out i turn up my boarding pass is printed off straight through security bang get on the plane bag in the overhead take the bag off the overhead through passport control out the front of the airport i ain't waiting for no [ __ ] luggage conveyors i ain't waiting for them to unload no planes do you know I've seen [ __ ] the last time my was with my girl she checked the bag in we were going to Vius Lithuania and there was some problem unloading the plane we're there for an hour and 15 minutes waiting for the [ __ ] bag i ain't got time to waste my life is short and I'm living a good life i ain't got time to [ __ ] waste do not check in bags that's the first thing second thing if you're traveling with a female females are slow they're annoying they're cumbersome females are not flexible females are not fast on their feet if you're traveling with a female that's fine you have to book your hotel in advance you have to organize everything because women have no ability to to to move like quickly but if you're traveling with just your boys the best thing you can do is [ __ ] all that garbage off don't plan [ __ ] planning things one it hinders your fun and two flexibility is the probably the largest part of this entire course we're talking about the flexibility to do what you want flexibility to earn how you want to earn wear what you want act how you want [ __ ] girls you want that's what flexibility is if I'm going to go to a country if I'm going to go to Chile I'm going to land in Santiago i don't have a [ __ ] hotel just [ __ ] rock up in Santiago i'll try and land in the middle of the day so you know I'm not struggling around at night and I'll [ __ ] go around i'll check out the different areas of town i'll find an area of town I like or a restaurant I like or a bar I like or whatever whatever i'll talk to some local people i'll see what they recommend then I'll walk in there with my [ __ ] checking bag and book a hotel room because I got money in the bank anyway it doesn't make a difference it's no cheaper if you book it in advance that's all garbage if you book these [ __ ] package holidays yeah but if you're just [ __ ] going to a hotel to book it it's no [ __ ] difference so [ __ ] that [ __ ] stay flexible unless you're traveling with a woman don't ever do that [ __ ] with a woman because a woman's gonna have a big ass [ __ ] check-in bag [ __ ] be get in and out of taxis she's going to get all angry and moody because you're trying to ask her to move quickly because she's a stupid [ __ ] females are slow cumbersome and annoying so you have to understand that this is only a trick for when you're traveling with your boys this is the next thing next thing people say don't advertise your wealth if you're going to dangerous places i wouldn't say that's necessarily true what I'd say is just make sure that the crew you're with is is a few people deep if you go to a dangerous place i went to Iraq with about 10 guys yeah an AK-47 could have killed us all but you never know maybe it'd only shoot eight of us and the other two could carry us out so depending on where you're going to go if you really start going to crazy places you do need to have people with you you see some of these travel bloggers especially the ones on Facebook the real [ __ ] liberal little cuck ones going "I went to Iran and it's super nice here." Yeah but you're you're not you're not a target you're not a target as a person because you're a little tiny person spending no money hiding in the shadows typing one in your blog if you're going to do the [ __ ] I do if you're going to roll up and ball out and [ __ ] try and get [ __ ] and spend money and bop bop you need to make sure that you have some crew with you you're going to be going to these dangerous kind of places flying first class people message me about flying private i've flown private a few times private flying flying private school but that's a who that's a whole level of money you're probably not going to obtain so let's talk about flying first class flying first class is only worthwhile if you need to sleep when you land because although it seems like a lot of money to sleep that's the only time I fly business or first class if I know that I'm going to spend that money but I'm going to have a real comfortable flight i'm going to sleep i'm going to nap i'm going to be in good shape and then when I wake up uh at the destination I'm ready to rock and roll if you land at 7 a.m at a place and you have a meeting or you only have a few days in a place you ain't got time to waste recovering that's when I fly first class otherwise to be honest with you even when you're at a super high income the price for first class is very rarely worth it that's that's the truth fly coach what the [ __ ] and that doesn't mean don't take sleeping pills like a little [ __ ] or whatever just [ __ ] sit in coach i'm 6'4 if I can sit in coach you can sit in coach it's not that big a deal and you can save that money if I fly to Thailand from Bookucharest Coach it's about 600 euro first class is €4,000 euro so doing with that extra 3,400 euro that that's my entire trip in Thailand for a month i could probably make that last for a month easily so just for the flight I mean unless I'm really doing like a real short-term in-n-out if I'm going to Monaco and I've got or I'm Monaco's too close if I'm going to New York and I have an important business meeting I'll fly first class so I can land the morning do the meeting leave the same night something like that otherwise you don't need first class in in general that's a waste of time so you have your bag you haven't had to check it in you're only flying first class if you really need to otherwise your coach is no problem you have two passports you have a couple driver's licenses cash people ask me if they should take a lot of cash with them you need to mix it up i mean like I say we live in a modern world i don't really believe in the whole going to ky exchanges thing it doesn't make sense to me if you have $10,000 for your trip and then you go to the currency exchange and convert to 10,000 local then you have to worry about losing that money you can go to any ATM in the country wherever you are basically and just draw money out in their local currency okay is it the best possible exchange rate no but you get money out as and when you need it it's better than having a whole [ __ ] ton of money sitting around and you can only travel with a certain amount of money internationally anyway so I'd have a little bit of cash but in general you can just use your card have money have three or four different cards have different banks tell the banks in in advance be careful of where you go obviously common sense [ __ ] that I don't have to [ __ ] tell you if you go to a dangerous place roll a few people deep and then it comes to girls that's what a lot of people who are ask who are on this course are about girls they're saying "Oh if you get girls in this country d only bit of advice I'd say with girls is this if you're going to bring a girl back to your hotel put your [ __ ] in the safe." Simple number of guys I know have lost their Rolex or watch or passport i'm like "Where was it?" They're looking in my hotel so where's the girl in my hotel so just put it in the safe every hotel has a safe like put your [ __ ] in the safe and then you can do whatever you want then bang her fall asleep what you going to do unless she's a complete psycho she's going to stab you in the neck which you know she wouldn't get away without me cuz I'm a ninja but for you average humans you have to think about that [ __ ] but in general that ain't going to happen and if you're going to get robbed it's your own fault i knew dudes who got robbed by some hookers in Thailand like he brought hookers back to her house in Thailand and left money all over the place and just went to sleep like come on guys common sense this travel tip video really is absolute common sense the two the only two real tips that are actually important for traveling is one do not check in a bag find a way to avoid that at all costs that's the first thing that's the most important thing and two have a couple passports with you but that comes from the previous video you'll see uh you should always have two passports with you anywhere you are whether you're traveling or not i do have a couple crazy travel stories i got kidnapped in Jamaica uh I got arrested and accused of being a spy um in fact I'll tell you the kidnapped in Jamaica story later but for now here's the time I was arrested and accused of being a spy in a country you've never heard of i'm going to do something I've yet to do on my YouTube channel which is tell you all a quick story the first half of this story is actually all on video as part of a web series I made called The Hateful Tate which nobody watched but I'm going to tell you the very quick version of it if you want more detail I recommend you watch the video we're going to link it in here anyway so me and my brother we decided a long time ago that there's going to be lots of [ __ ] at the Eurovvision Song Contest we came to this conclusion because lots of people go there from all around the world it's pop music it's [ __ ] we thought there'd be some hoes so we thought "Fuck it one of these days we have to go to Eurovision." Last year it was in Kief ukraine ukraine is some of the hottest girls in the world so we thought "Fuck it we're going to go to Eurovision this is the year to do it we're going to go to Kief." We decided this about two days before Eurovvision all the flights into Kiev were completely booked it was extremely difficult to get into the country so we thought "How the [ __ ] we going to do this?" Right now we're at Bookucharest Romania this is my house you look at a map we're about six hours from the Moldovven border so we thought "Fuck it we're going to drive." We jumped in the car started driving got six hours to the border of Muldova and they wouldn't let us through the border because we didn't know at the time but you need to have the original paperwork to go into Muldova cuz all the cars in Europe that are stolen end up in Muldova so they're very strict at the borders unless you bribe them which I tried to do and they wouldn't accept cuz they didn't know me you need to have the original document we can't there's no like way we can is there a fine or we pay a fine or a penalty anything we can do it's not about the penalty or it's about the car that will not leave the country you have to have the original paperwork we only had photo copies of our paperwork we don't keep the original paperwork in the car so they wouldn't let us through so we parked our car at a train station in a town called Yash on the border of Romania we then went up to a taxi say "Can you take us to Kisha which is the capital of the neighboring country Malddova." effectively being in France and saying he can take me to Berlin the capital of Germany it's a long taxi drive finally found a guy who would do it 130 Europe for more money than we should have paid he took us to Kishnau when we were in Kishnau we had to negotiate a way to Kiev we found an overnight train and we got there problem is on the overnight train I nearly got robbed that train is completely mafia run that train is you can bribe your way in and out you don't have to show a passport you don't have to go through customs so all the Russian mafia who travel in and out of Romania and Malddova come in and out by train they do not go by plane so that's a mafia run train and that was a very difficult and scary experience up until this point all of this is recorded and part of the hateful tape series which we're going to put link to so feel free to watch it and find the details of me nearly getting robbed now the train all that [ __ ] so anyway the web series ends eurovision's over me and my brother are in Ukraine we got to get out so we're like how the [ __ ] do we get out all the planes are booked for another week we don't want to stay in Ukraine for another week we don't want to take the train again because of what happened the first time so we're like well you can't fly can't take a train can't take a boat the only way is to drive we get to drive out here somehow so we're going from taxi driver to taxi driver taxi driver saying can you drive us to Romania and it turns out that Ukrainians at the time which is now changed I believe needed a visa to get into Romania so it was very difficult to find a taxi driver with a visa who was prepared to do a [ __ ] 18-hour drive at a whim so we're sitting around Ukraine for 12 hours every taxi driver I'm ordering Ubers i'm calling everyone up saying "Look I need to get Romania i'll pay." I mean it's I was offering five six times the market rate like I was saying "Look I'm going to give you two grand." Remember these people make $250 $300 a month i was offering him $2,000 for one drive it's like "Get me to [ __ ] Romania i've got [ __ ] to do i've got to get out of this country." Eventually a guy we meet a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy who knows a guy that says "I have a guy who has a visa to go into Romania and he's a very good driver he's an ex rally driver and he's going to drive you." And we're like "Well thank [ __ ] let's go so anyway me and my brother he said "Meet us here at this time." So 11:00 at night me and my brother are standing on a street corner waiting for [ __ ] Mr noame to turn up in the middle of Kiev Ukraine it's a dangerous city we're standing there combat mode obviously chilling the guy turns up now I expected like ex- rally driver some kind of super G to turn up some little [ __ ] some loser turns up some dude must been about [ __ ] 17 hi like hi who are you goes "Oh I'm your driver." I thought you were a rally driver goes "I was a rally driver." like when when you were 12 what the [ __ ] since when did you drive when you're 12 like whatever have you got a visa goes Yeah I got a visa we're like okay we trust you so anyway Mr 12-year-old decides to drive us tristan goes Tristan's nervous in cars my brother's been in four car accidents none of which he's been driving he's always been the passenger in cars when cars have been wrecked car accidents people have died in like big car accidents but my brother being a Tate doesn't die easy so he's very nervous in cars he goes "I'm [ __ ] I'm a bit nervous it's an 18 hour car drive we got [ __ ] 12-year-old driving us there's no street lights in Ukraine ukraine doesn't even have 3G on the mobile phone you have to have Wi-Fi even if you have a Ukrainian SIM you can't check Facebook Twitter nothing ukraine is is much poorer than Romania i didn't expect that romania is a poor country ukraine's a [ __ ] poor country it's a war zone it's a [ __ ] war anyway so there's no street lights the roads are bad trist is a bit nervous she goes "You know what this is going to be a long ass drive let's get a bottle of vodka." I like "All right cool." So we go into the store i remember this because how cheap it was we got two Snickers bars a b one liter of vodka two uh cartons of cherry juice and a pack of peanuts for €2 including the vodka including a liter of vodka €2 [ __ ] crazy cheap so we buy the vodka anyways we get in the car we're sitting in the back of the car drinking vodka we're driving down these roads pitch black can't see [ __ ] we don't know where we are our 3G isn't loading on our phone so we can't see where we are we're just sitting in the back drinking vodka talking [ __ ] mr rally driver is telling us about his imaginary rally career [ __ ] didn't even finish high school we ain't been rallying for nobody so we're driving driving driving driving all of a sudden me and Trist we're This is about 6 hours in liter of vodka's gone so between me and T have had half a liter each or whatever we're a little bit drunk we're chilling i see someone out the side of the car blacked out head to toe black i said Tristan you see that but it's black out anyway he's like "What's that?" I said "Who the [ __ ] is this?" We're driving down this bumpy road tristan's looking out the window and there's another dude blacked i mean black balaclava black ski mask black jumpsuit black head to toe what the [ __ ] at this point me and him are drunk it's two o'clock in the morning we're on the border of Ukraine we have no idea where we're staring our windows and we start seeing all these guys dressed in complete [ __ ] black we just like so we said to the rally driver "Where are we?" He goes "Uh Ukraine." We're like "Where in Ukraine?" Now I had a friend who once got robbed in Ukraine he got into the back of a taxi and the taxi driver was driving the taxi driver stopped two guys got in each side of him while he was in the back both with knives put the knives to him and robbed him so I thought "Okay so we're about to get [ __ ] robbed." So I said to the rally driver I said "My friend you better [ __ ] hope I get home." He's like "What?" I said "You better [ __ ] hope I get home alive i'm not the kind of guy you want to [ __ ] with even if you kill me you better hope I get home alive." I started threatening the taxi driver i'm making it clear i ain't dying easy if I die I'm taking you with me you [ __ ] lo i thought he was about to set me up anyway all of a sudden car stops get out the car get out of the car hear all these people getting out of the car carries look at each other like for [ __ ] sake like we should have known better this is Ukraine shit's about to go down so we get out the car the people who are dressed head to toe in black turns out are Russian soldiers all Russian soldiers i'm going to give you all a quick geography lesson because I didn't know any of this geography up until this event which I researched post so here's the geography lesson when the USSR fell in the early 1990s Muldova was being established as a country uh Mold there's part of Moldova that wanted to remain pro-Russian moldova is like half Romania half Russia half the people speak Romanian half the people speak Russian it was all part of the USSR meaning it bespoke Russian when the USSR fell the Romanians gained influence and all the Russian population were afraid that when the country officially changes to a Romanian speaking government they're going to steal all the money which is exactly what they did because it's a corrupt country so the Russians wanted to remain part of Russia so a civil war kicked off and to this day even though this war was in 1992 there's an area of Moldova called Transnistria which wants to be part of Russia which isn't part of Russia like a Crimea breakaway micro nations about 20 or 30 km in length tiny little dot on the map which I'd never [ __ ] heard of up until this point so me and my brother got in the car Russian soldiers from head to toe blacked out and not just soldiers not like you imagine a soldier with like a green thing on and a gun special forces blacked out and the reason they were there is because all the Crimea war [ __ ] was just going down at this time the Crimea Peninsula and all this crap in fact I read it when I was researching posts that the eur the European Union was concerned that the next place Russia would annex would be Transnistria because they had such a pro-Russian mindset so the Russian government has kept a military presence there since 1992 and it was [ __ ] loaded with with Russian soldiers we just got the car with our hands up they got guns pointed at ass we're like "Yeah what the [ __ ] are you?" Like this is more than just a routine robbery they even had our Mr [ __ ] rally driver at gunpoint so we're all at gunpoint they take us arrest us march us sit us down in this room and they're like "Who?" Firstly they start talking to us in Russian like "My friend we don't speak Russian." It was a good 10-minute conversation with them yelling at us in Russian and us saying "We don't speak Russian till they finally agreed to find someone who spoke English." I don't think they even believed we didn't speak Russian i think they were sure we spoke Russian before they finally conceded left the room these two big [ __ ] guys and got some other [ __ ] huge dude to come and sit down with his broken ass English and he said 'What are you doing here i said 'What am I doing where i'm trying to go back to Romania said 'Where did you come from?' I said 'The Eurovvision Song Contest so what the [ __ ] else now probably a lot of times people have looked at me like I'm a [ __ ] in my life but the biggest the most important event in my life or the time I was looked at like the biggest [ __ ] ever was this Russian soldier looking at me and my brother 3:00 in the morning in the middle of a [ __ ] microation war zone and I said "I've been there i'm there because of the Eurovvision Song Contest." He looked at me he's like "This guy's either the biggest idiot I've ever met or a brave motherfucker." Anyway by completely terrible coincidence my brother and I were wearing black we had black t-shirts on i had black jeans he had black juggling balls on he said "Why are you dressed in black?" I said "I don't know man we just got a taxi from train we're trying to go back to Romania." He goes "You're impersonating soldiers it's 3:00 in the morning you're pretending you come from Eurovvision you're dressed in black what are you doing here?" So they accused us of being American spies we're like "We're not spies we just want to go back to Romania so we're sitting there in the interview room they come in now let me tell you one thing that did actually cross my mind because I'm a combatant individual that's what I do this is what I did for a living so it always crosses my mind to fight it always cross mind thinking "Okay this situation's pretty bad can I fight my way out of this?" There's two guys in the room with me both armed they're both big guys but I could probably take them hand to hand because it's close combat but once I get out there's [ __ ] like 30 guys they had attack dogs Rottweilers the whole [ __ ] law there's no way I can fight out this all I can do is try and like go along with the [ __ ] process they bring our suitcases out the car they pour all our [ __ ] on the floor the dogs start going through our suitcases these guys start ruffling through our stuff they search me and Tristan they take uh we have to take our t-shirt off take our jeans off we're standing in our [ __ ] underwear handcuffed in a [ __ ] little booth i'm going to try and Google and find a picture of the exact spot so you can see it a little booth in Transnistria being accused of being American spies we have American and British passports at 3:00 in the morning we're in a micronation breakaway i was desperate to get on my phone and the reason for this is I just actually met Donald Trump Jr about a month or a month and a half before this so I have him on WhatsApp he's my boy and I've got two or three very important Romanian politicians high level of secretary of state etc on WhatsApp so I thought I can just get to my WhatsApp and just send some messages the Russian they're going to want to kill me i mean they're going to keep me for a while this might go on a few weeks let me just get on WhatsApp and speak to some important people and try and get the [ __ ] out of here so I was saying look guys just give me my phone i've got a guy in Romania who can speak Romanian and Russian and you can talk to him and he'll explain to you that I am not a spy i'm just a [ __ ] idiot who went to a shitty song contest and got in the wrong taxi my taxi driver Mr [ __ ] decided to drive through a [ __ ] war zone i didn't know i didn't know this was still technically at war i had no [ __ ] idea i look at the rally guy who was kept separate to me and T i kept looking out the window and the rally guy was still out on the gravel road so I should have known not to trust a 12-year-old he's standing outside with a gun pointed at his head [ __ ] wet in his pants me and Trist are sitting there arrested in our underwear handcuffed saying "Look we're not spies we're not spies why are you dressed like soldiers we're not spies." Anyway I sat and said to the guy I said "Look let me get my phone i'll make some phone calls this will go away." He says "You're not going to touch your phone for a very long time." I said "My friend." He said "Don't call me your friend." I said "Fine i'm not a spy i'm an idiot just take the money that's in my bag and let me go." And this is what I love about corrupt countries he didn't say yes or no he spoke to turned to his friend and said something in Russian they spoke in Russian for a few seconds and I can guess what he said he said "Count how much money is in his bag." They went in my bag and they started going through my bag looking for money and they went through it and they found about $7,000 American dollars and they sat there and he goes "I never instantly there was no pretending that they weren't going to do it they found the 7,000 was actually quite nice of them because they could have just took it and kept me to be fair but I guess you know they were men of honor." He goes "Okay here's the deal i never want to see you again." I was like "Trust me my friend i guarantee you're never going to see me again." They took the 7,000 they let us put our clothes back on they load us back in the taxi with the dork and they escorted us out with one of those [ __ ] Humvey trucks with guns pointed us the entire time straight out to a [ __ ] TP or wherever we were so what's the moral of the story the moral of the story is quite quite a few morals one don't take the train from Kisha to Kiev if you want to live two don't take taxis from Kiev to anywhere if you want to live don't go to war zone stay out of that part of the world this is a part of the world that no one goes to i live in a part of the world that basically no one goes to and then I go a little bit further to the area where literally nobody goes no one speaks English there's no big Americans there i live here because I make money here but really it's a crazy part of the world the reason I'm telling this story is because me and my brother and I are due to go back there in two days we tried to avoid going but a friend of ours invited us he said "Look we got some work there we got some business there you're going to make some money on top of that there's a miniskirt competition i mean come on who doesn't want to go to a mini skirt competition in a war zone?" Like what the [ __ ] like there's a whole bunch of beautiful ass women who can't escape and they like mini skirt competitions it's a crazy place no one goes there nobody goes here i've I know I've given all of you a geography lesson none of you have heard of this place for sure and now you're all on Google like "What the fuck?" So anyway I'm going there in two days time hopefully I don't run into my friend the border guard this time I've actually got a visa i've been I've seen my boys in Romania i've got high level visa Romanian visa saying "Look he's diplomat he's allowed to come." Blah blah blah so hopefully they'll let me in and out with ease but um subscribe because everything that goes down while I'm there in a couple days time is going to end up on the YouTube channel that's exclusive so you have to be subscription otherwise you're not going to get it subscribe for that and if you want any more details on this amazing story like I said watch the Hateful Tate series and you'll see everything that went [Music] down so now you've completed the course or maybe you jumped ahead and you watched this video some people do that right they jump to the last last video or whatnot but here's what I want you to take away from this entire course implementation actually implement it don't watch this be like "Wow CMQ's awesome andrew's awesome this is so cool it's entertaining." Obviously Andrew is super entertaining you've been watching for [ __ ] days but actually take the information dissect it and read between the lines a lot of the stuff that we're saying might seem simple you might be like "Well [ __ ] i thought you know I was going to learn something that was just mindblowing." But it's not it's actually implementing it take with this information and actually implement it because it's going to make a huge difference because you basically have a choice right now first off you've been given an opportunity that 99.9999% of people in the world will never get right you're getting access to two legit G's who are giving you this information right we didn't have to make this course wasn't about the money you know it's it's really not i mean you buy this course to not affect our life in any in any [ __ ] shape or form we appreciate it thank you but it doesn't affect us but this information can completely change your life and that's what's important because you have a choice now you now have this information so you can continue on a normal life or you can continue or you can change and switch gears and take the the path less traveled and take a different route and it's totally up to you you might watch all this and say you know what it's not for me i want to work a regular job i don't want to travel i don't want to [ __ ] beautiful women and that's totally cool like legitimately it's totally cool that's what most of the world's made up of but is that really what you want are you happy if you're happy then great but you're not happy that's why you got this course deep down you're like "Something's missing i want something more." And most importantly you probably said "I want to be [ __ ] free." And that's really to sum the summation of all this is about true [ __ ] freedom freedom of money freedom of where you live freedom of the women that you choose that you want not "Well this girl winked at me and so now I'm going to go talk to her and and I guess I'll stay with her for 50 [ __ ] years." No I like that girl i'm going to go get her that is [ __ ] power andrew knows a lot of celebrities i know celebrities they don't even have that level of [ __ ] game i'm dead [ __ ] serious they literally well yeah but I can't just go up to her like "You're a [ __ ] celebrity if I was world famous and I get recognized everywhere i was in [ __ ] Cypress to get recognized [ __ ] New York LA Vegas all over the world from my brand which is crazy i mean it's it's known in the internet world but like I'm not on TMZ i'm not on billboards but when you have that power which comes from choice then you feel like a man because you're not going "Well I guess I'll take this and I have to settle because I I don't have the choice to go get the money I want and to get the girls I want." So in conclusion take this information actually implement it and when you're living that life of true freedom hit us up you know me on Twitter email me let me know i want to hear your success stories i want to hear your victories and I want to say I do appreciate you man no matter if your parents are mad at you or if your parents sick you're a loser or your best friend's being a [ __ ] or your girlfriend's being a [ __ ] [ __ ] them all we believe in you go out there and get it hello my name is Tristan Tate now you've purchased the Andrew Tate how to be a G course so I imagine many of you know who I am i'm Andrew's younger brother and a very good friend of Christians now there are very few things about game that you could teach a man like Christian McQueen however when guys like us get together we talk we exchange tips and I hit him with the genius way I organize the contacts in my phone he's now using the same system and as people who have bought the how to be a GCourse he thought I should share it with you the way I organize my phone is very complex because I'm a man who does a lot of different approaches i use a lot of dating apps i meet a lot of women so I need a way of filing them in a way that I don't lose track i first developed the system some years ago what happened was I had approached a beautiful girl i got her number and I was messaging her very hard on WhatsApp for a day or two i was then messaging too many other girls too many other people and I lost track of her nine days later she hit me with a message i guess you don't really want to meet up then no matter how I tried to explain my way out of it and say "Baby it's okay let's still go out." She said "You've been on WhatsApp for 9 days online every day and you haven't written me once you're obviously a player i'm tired of guys like you and I never met her again." The way I organize my phone is based on three different elements one the priority of the girl in question how important she is to me now this is either based on looks or her commitment level to you your main chick and your girlfriends for example are more important than the girls you'll call late night after the club the second element is the name now the name isn't just what their name is for example here in Romania Andrea is a very popular name my phone has seven Andreas in it so you need to way of knowing which Andrea is which the third is the location it's good to know where the girls in your phone are located for example if you go to a city once every six months or once every three months it's good to know who you have in that city that you could potentially meet up with if I were to store a contact in my phone this is how it's done first a number between 1 and three the number between 1 and three is the girl's priority for example when I wake up every morning I press one in my phone book and all the girls that appear with the number one next to their name are the ones I message first thing the "Hey baby I was had a dream about you last night i hope to see you real soon." Now these are your main chicks your girlfriends the girls that you really love banging and you see three or four times a week these are your ones your twos are the girls that you care about but not as much as your number on's girls who think you're busier than you are but you see once every 10 days every two weeks there's something about her you really appreciate and you really like but she's never going to be a main chick when a two sends you a message you reply to a two immediately but you don't necessarily have to message her every morning when you wake up you have to take care of your twos because you don't want to lose them because they matter to you somewhat but you don't have to maintain them constantly like you do with your most important girls your threes are the kind of girls that you call after a night out it's 5:00 you're in the club you're bored that's when you message your threes if they message you at a time like that reply but a three is not so important that when she messages you she can instantly demand your time you manage your threes on your own terms when you get bored and you're sitting on your phone for three hours waiting at the airport message your ones twos and threes keep all your girls entertained keep all of them interested now this priority system would have stopped me from making the mistake that I made with that girl i would have saved her as a one because she was stunningly hot i was actively pursuing her and trying to bang her so for those nine days I ignored her she would have got a good morning message every single morning saving a girl's name is very important to do correctly and there are many girls who have the same name if you do a lot of approaches and you're trying to meet lots of different women you're going to encounter some girls that you don't even remember meeting especially when you're out in clubs drunk so when you save their contact details make it as clear as you like what I like to do is her name followed by her Instagram handle so I can always check how hot she is and follow up on how good she looks to make sure that my eyes weren't deceiving me after 20 bottles of vodka the girl's name is Andrea for example her Instagram tag or Andrea the blonde I met in this club that's the way to save your girl's names that way you can't make a mistake and you can't do what I've done Christian has done and Andrew have done many times before which is confuse a girl for somebody else you instantly lose them the third most important thing to put when you're saving a contact in your phone is the city name now this takes a very long time for it to actually become useful but as you slowly build up your contacts list as a man who travels and does approaches worldwide like me you slowly accumulate a list of girls in various cities so if there are cities you visit once every six months or once every 3 months me Marba for example I can go to Marba type Marba into my phone book and the six or seven numbers I have in Marba will appear you can then hit that girl with a "Hey babe just came to Marbaya you're the first person I thought of." She'll reply "Oh my god I didn't know you still remembered me." Doesn't matter if you remembered her you know she lives in Marba because the contact is saved as Marba so to recap every time you save a girl's number in your phone if I'm in New York City and I approach a beautiful brunette named Samantha she's not that good-looking but I definitely want to see her if I'm there I'd save her as three Samantha her Instagram handle and New York City when I'm in New York 6 months down the line and I type New York City I could see Samantha's number is there if Samantha was a 10 out of 10 gorgeous girl who lived here in my city of Bookucharest I'd save her as one Samantha Bookucharest that way every day when I wake up I type number one in my phone Samantha appears along with my other priority girls the girls I have the girls I badly want and she gets messaged every single day there's no chance I forget disclaimer the one two and three depending on the operating system of your phone you have to be careful with my phone the Tenino Lamborghini typing the number one comes up with my contacts that start with one i do realize that with some phones if you press one it will start to dial a number one or show every number with a one in it in which case you simply save it as o ne phonetically spell the number one two and three but it is the same system whether you're new to the game of approaching and dating multiple women or it's something you already do I hope you find this system useful thanks for listening i get asked a lot how to grow an Instagram page and I think the different social medias have very different there's very different objectives and very different advantages to to growing each one of them for example I became quite big on Twitter i started Twitter with a th000 followers i got to 12,000 followers in like three weeks and then I got to 45,000 followers in two months and I got banned but that's because I'm an exceptionally hilarious individual but Twitter all it it does gain you perhaps monetary contacts and political conversations and a shitload of hate a whole bunch of people who hate you but in general I mean unless you're really making money from Twitter having a large Twitter following I mean yeah you can make some money from it but I don't think it's as beneficial as having a large Instagram following because a large Instagram following leads to girls and [ __ ] is is one of the best things on the planet um that's why a lot of you join this course a lot of you want to have more money more girls so you your Twitter account has to be for your money and your Instagram account has to be for your girls you're not getting girls on Twitter absolutely not so how to grow an Instagram following growing a Twitter following is very much about what you say so I can't coach you how to do that the reason mine grew so fast is because I'm the [ __ ] man uh and the way I think and the way I write it etc etc but an Instagram following is going to happen absolutely not really by default if you follow every other lesson in this video course if you start making a load of money and you have nice cars and you start traveling the world with your multiple passports and you start taking pictures with Hulk girls and going to cool places you're going to have a large Instagram following there really isn't too big a secret to it besides that my Instagram following isn't massive i mean I know there's people with loads and loads and loads i've got 25,000 followers it's not a huge deal but it's enough i probably say two or three random girls a day inbox my Instagram and just say some [ __ ] and the reason for that is because they look at my lifestyle and it emulates a lifestyle that they'd like to have so they probably just slept with their boyfriend they're about to go to work in Starbucks they don't want to go to work they're scrolling through Instagram they stumble upon me they see my lifestyle and they think "Oh [ __ ] hell this guy looks like he has fun." Because if you look like you have fun you attract women all women want is fun so by portraying a life of fun you're going to attract females and that's what your Instagram should be for you have to make your life look fun and that's going to become very easy if you follow the other lessons in this course one thing I would say is have your Instagram on private the reason for that is because unless you're a super hot girl super hot girls have a completely different Instagram mechanism to a man but to a man there's be a lot of people who look at your life and spy on it but they don't want to follow you they just want to have a little look and then they get bored if you have it on private they have to give you that follow to find out what's going down so I have mine private for that reason i gain a lot more followers when mine's on private because people are curious and people are nosy but in general you need to portray an image of fun when your Instagram account's on private hashtags don't matter because people can't search the hashtag because your account's private none of that [ __ ] matters all that really matters is you have a life of fun keep it private people will tell that other people someone will follow you and say "Have you seen this guy's account?" No d and then they'll go and follow you from there so really it's about the pictures you take there's no secret to Instagram besides the pictures you take and the pictures you take are going to become fantastic because you're going to follow everything else in this course you're going to climb a mountain that you've never climbed before you're going to do some crazy [ __ ] it's going to be you and 10 girls wherever wherever and you take a cool picture um another thing though there's no perfect algorithm to anything if you're too show off on Instagram you are going to lose some girls you are going to piss some people off you can't go through the world pleasing everybody you really can't go through the world pleasing everybody we're wrapping up now we've been doing all these videos and I've kind of tried to reiterate over and over again about how you how to be a G you need to do this you need to do this you need to do this if you start living this way everyone's going to give you hate like everyone's going to hate you but there's no way in life to get anywhere without being hated the only way you can not be hated is if you say nothing and do nothing and have no opinion but then is that a life worth living no it doesn't matter if you It doesn't matter if you say the sky the earth is round there's going to be someone out there who hates you for it there's a whole group of flat earthers they think you're wrong so anything you achieve or anywhere you go in life you're going to attract hate you're going to attract people dislike you the most important thing is just to really be above all that [ __ ] um I was I was exceptionally good at that on Twitter exceptionally good when when I was saying the things I was saying and people were sending me thousands I got hundreds of thousands of replies in some of my tweets of pure hate wishing me the worst possible things insulting my dead father anything they could think of to try and bother me I never gave a [ __ ] I don't it doesn't affect me I don't care and that's how you need to be thinking about growing an Instagram following you're going to put some cool pictures up and there's going to be a whole bunch of people who give you hate good because if someone's going out of their if someone's going out of their way to bother responding to a picture of your life you've emotionally affected them so you right now you've emotionally affected them you've won the exchange if they emotionally affect you back which is their intention then it's 50/50 but if you just read it and laugh and don't give a [ __ ] go whatever then you won you have space in their brain they don't have space in your brain that's how it works so there is no key to growing an Instagram following in fact a very good measurement of how well you've implemented the rules and laws and and and videos from this course is how your Instagram account starts to grow if you if you implement everything properly and you're starting to get more likes and people are starting to look at your life and think "Wow this looks cool this looks cool." are starting to go up then you're going to start to see well you know that's a very easy quantifiable you know I'm not saying it's the only thing that matters but it's it's it's absolutely an added bonus to living a life worth living because everyone wants to live a life worth living and that's what Instagram's for people scroll through it and they look at other people's lives and everyone's lives looks perfect well it's your turn to have a life that looks perfect and it hasn't got to be perfect it's just got to be really fun for small periods of time and make sure you snap a photo all right man so for context for everyone watching the video today's the day the Trump balloon goes up in London so in London there's a huge uh anti-Trump demonstration right because Trump's busy right and they wanted to put up a huge blimp of Trump as a baby uh and a lot of people were saying it's not constitutional and why would you do that the American president and Sadi Khan the London mayor uh Sadique Kuck yeah kuck he's so anti-Trump he provoked them and endorsed them put up a huge balloon of Trump through London and there's a big debate about on the news saying would you have would you have endorsed him to put up a big balloon of a black Barack Obama or you as a pig because you're a Muslim or anything like oh he's like oh I I believe in freedom of speech some complete garbage hat complete if you put [ __ ] idiots the fact that they think that protesting and marching through a street is going to somehow one affect anything firstly and secondly as if if the president changes their life's going to be better here's the deal this is actually a good point this ties into something the energy you give to something you give yourself over to right so if you give yourself over to being a cuck you're going to become a cuck if you give yourself over to hating Trump your hate is not going to end him your hate is not going to take away his billions his hot ass [ __ ] wife or his presidency so people spend this energy invested in other people we have tons of haters online it doesn't affect us it legitimately doesn't a matter of fact it provides entertainment but it ruins their life because all the energy they're spending hating on us could be spent on banging girls and making money which is what we do and this leads me into the question how does a man how does a gay bang multiple girls in one day he's legitimately hand to God [ __ ] four girls today and it's it's 2:30 [ __ ] the key is for me personally is and you know it t it's it's not easy but I don't sleep i split my nights up so usually what happens is you [ __ ] every man wants to fall asleep after he [ __ ] you fall asleep and that's the end of the night i somehow find the mental fortitude to to bang chill there for like an hour hour and a half so I'm not too rude get up say I got work to do and disappear somewhere else because if you have a haram of girls they all want to see you especially at night that's my know that you're out with another girl they know you're out having fun and they want they want to be the one you come back to that's actually my number one problem during the day I can be [ __ ] free all day when the night falls all my girls start being like "Oh stay with me stay with me all of them and then check my Instagram story i'm in the club and I got other hoes like please stay with me and if I don't stay with them they're a bit like "Oh I know he I know he didn't go home alone." Exactly i know he's somewhere so now I'm at a level now where I'm just like "Okay yeah I'll be there i'm going to be late i'll be there." I got [ __ ] message on the phone right now i'm not going to be there till 8 she's like "You're out till 8." I was like "Yeah I'm out totally i've got them scheduled in two hour slots just [ __ ] deal with it quick." So I kind of half sleep but physically though if you know you're going to [ __ ] multiple girls cuz you know like if you pull a chick like my chick last night this morning whatever like I know that I wasn't going to go bang another girl cuz the night was over so you can put that energy into it but do you like not go as long with them when you're banging them i mean how I don't know you know with these girls a lot of them I've been with them so long like some of them especially i It's not like you have to spend an hour piping them out n Exactly and you can do it right within 20 minutes anyway but I've been with them so long i literally just walk in i'll be tired as [ __ ] i'll say "Viv suck this." I'll half fall asleep i think it takes a half an hour to get all I want i've known her for ages it's not like I'm trying to impress or nothing like whatever so I do what I got to do but basically yeah I just I just [ __ ] slot them all in because that makes my life so much easier for the following days so much easier so I just got to do what I got to do so that's what it is that's how you do it don't sleep don't sleep if you have multiple hoes they're like "Oh you're coming home to me tonight." I've had that loads of times people say to me "What do I do if I have two girls or both brothers ask me to come home?" It's like "Fuck them both the [ __ ] you mean tell one of them you got something really important to do you got lots of work to do blah blah blah blah you got you got to leave at 4:00 a.m make up some [ __ ] tell the other one you're on the clock till 4:00 a.m bam double solution so really it's about scheduling it's about scheduling and and and and not falling asleep after you jizz which is what every man wants to we're all like "Oh I want to go to sleep now." The key is as soon as you jizz to actually like sit up or not lay down you lay down you're done absolutely you're [ __ ] done so that is the key to [ __ ] multiple girls not that any of the people in the Trump rally are ever going to need this information talk about the front these [ __ ] dorks man it pissed me off i saw you this morning these people I just don't understand it and what you said is actually a a quote I read from like I'm not a big on religions and [ __ ] but one one Buddhist guy i I'm not actually a huge fan of Buddh Buddhism people talk about Buddhism like it's the greatest thing in the world buddhism in my mind is like it's it's loads of perception without judgment like they they perceive everything but they don't judge which is sometimes cool and sometimes it's stupid sometimes you have to judge the world and judge people you know but um one of the things they said was absolutely true when you hate someone that's poison inside of you not poison inside of them like it makes absolutely no difference to their life and you knew from your Twitter account now and when I had my one people sitting there desperate to upset me like they're you're already upset so if I don't let you upset me I win so [ __ ] you like it's crazy it's really crazy that people put all this energy into hating something else it really is it's It's I think why they do it is because it allows them to escape their reality of knowing like so here's an example if you're a loser and I can focus my energy on hating on you and trying to prove that you're a loser Yeah then it takes the attention off of me looking at my own self and realizing I'm a [ __ ] idiot absolutely it's selfhate i said this loads of times i said "If your life is perfect if your life was genuinely the way you wanted to be and you were genuinely a happy contented person you had everything you wanted and you [ __ ] your life was completely on track." Would you sit there hate and drunk exactly would you [ __ ] you wouldn't care like I don't care i'm busy my life's good and even though we like him we don't we're not sitting here even worried about Yeah we don't give a [ __ ] our lives are good so I'm not going to sit there and be like "Oh Trump and writing him or even being a fanboy this can go the opposite too the people that are super [ __ ] fanboys like I respect Trump he's a jade obviously um but I'm not going to sit there writing and praising him all day that's also a waste of energy absolutely so it doesn't have to be necessarily negative energy your [ __ ] energy should be focused on yourself listen if you're not a millionaire if you don't have hot girls then you're not doing enough that is literally that simple your energy is all you have in life exactly it's all you have in life you got to put it into something that's going to directly absolutely and positively affect you people think politics is I know people buy the politics trap because they believe that it's going to change which is which is when Barack got into office i remember I was sitting with this hot ass Latin Instagram it's another story in LA and she was actually a Republican or whatever but like we sat there I'm like "Fuck." And that was it and I literally that was my reaction when they called it and then went on to have the literally to to come out of [ __ ] [ __ ] and to make money like it did literally didn't matter it really did not matter the only time it would really matter if the president is like they came in they're like 75% tax or something most of this [ __ ] doesn't matter people worried about Row versus Wade and [ __ ] like they're going to take away abortion it's not going to happen what's crazy is even if they did go somewhere else well this is it what we were saying earlier on in the course about being international one of the main reasons we don't give a [ __ ] about politics how many countries you've been to in the last three months do you know the president do you know the president of Andor do you [ __ ] I want to know it though cuz if you know it if you travel properly and you've got [ __ ] multiple passports you're going here there and everywhere you don't give a [ __ ] who the president is i roll up in the country i don't know who's in charge i don't give a [ __ ] i do what I got to do and I leave i make a mess and I'm out who cares we're in Romania now i've been here [ __ ] a year and a half i still only know the person's first name is Johan something i don't know like it doesn't matter to me if you're jumping around all other places it doesn't matter if you're stuck in one place and you're stuck working a job you hate and your wife's a fat [ __ ] and you're stuck there and your life's [ __ ] then you start instead of looking at your own life thinking "I need to change my life." You start thinking "Well maybe if the president was different maybe if America was different like no your life's [ __ ] and you're stuck in one place nothing to do with anything else." I think that's actually that's a good point i think a lot of people specifically in America that's why they're so depressed depressed because it's a choice when that situation is that they are stuck because think of it go to college and what's the next step you must get a mortgage why because it ties into that state paying taxes you must get married if you get if you get divorced we're going to wreck your life so it keeps them trapped i'm telling you man men are absolutely and not really in in the Western world i've traveled everywhere and what I've seen is and I've complet I've seen it with my own eyes i've noticed two very important things one in poorer countries are more fun and they're more free the more poor country is the more free a country is and two the level of cuckness for men is is much higher in a rich civilized country so the point I'm making because it's soft so what I noticed is like if you go to countries that are poor quote unquote poor even here Romania is poor there's no speed limits we're burning around doing what we want we act like idiots psychos that we can say what we want we have absolute free speech we can do what we want we have none of the problems none of the [ __ ] fake rape and all this [ __ ] you got in the west none of it here but it's a poor country so the freedom of of a population is directly linked to the wealth of a nation and the reason that the people in America are so depressed is because the men especially because everyone gives a [ __ ] about women no one gives a [ __ ] about men everyone talks constantly about women how women feel women this women that no one ever sits down and goes "You know what life's actually hard for a dude." And life's hard for a dude because even if you're born good-looking which none of us really are because men are not beautiful creatures like females are even if you're born exceptionally good-look you still need to be witty and smart and have a nice car have a nice apartment and have confidence and you need all this [ __ ] you're still not going to get laid if the girl you're born hot you're done i said I'm done i ain't going to do nothing i can be a [ __ ] it's true so life's hard as a man but no one gives a [ __ ] about the mental health of the mental health of men is because men are the [ __ ] workar ants that pay the taxes to the rich companies and the rich in the in the rich countries this is why these rich countries specifically try and cuck men exactly as you said the western world sits there and thinks we don't want men like Andrew Tay and Christian McQueen who freethink we don't want that what we want is men who marry a wife who doesn't respect them have kids who who don't respect them sit there semi-depressed drinking beer and watching football but their taxes are paid on time that's all they give a [ __ ] about and that's the reason these countries are rich the reason the countries are rich is because you have a whole bunch of worker ants getting up at 5:00 a.m going on the train going to work working all day train home wife's a [ __ ] to them [ __ ] kids don't like them jerking off the poor in the bathroom and going to sleep again and that's their life you tell me they're not depressed and when I said depression wasn't real they're like "Oo it is real." No depressing situations are real [ __ ] I'd be depressed if I was living that life so were you but it doesn't mean depression as a disease isn't real your life's just depressing you live depressing situation but this is what they want in the West they want this because they want you to just sit there convinced that if you work hard enough or you follow the rules long enough somehow it'll all be okay it's a fact the other thing is too it's like the Viagra commercials you see the old man and they show it's it's like a good-looking older white-haired man and then a good-looking which doesn't exist when a woman's past 50 yeah good-looking older white woman they're like walking through a park and they're like "You just need Viagra Silence." Guarant [ __ ] teed if that dude is 60 and you put a [ __ ] 20-year-old hot ass chick on his lap he's not gonna need Viagra yeah but they make it acceptable yeah oh it's your problem you need to take this medicine so you can [ __ ] her it's [ __ ] insane you don't want to [ __ ] her you've known her 40 years the pussy's got little gray pubes on it like you don't want this it's true man most people in their marriages are absolutely and heartly miserable and I mean I mean my theory on marriage is maybe my theory is a little bit extreme but I truly believe I I think a man at the peak of his his testosterone and a man who if he's truly honest with himself and I say this a lot of men disagree with me so maybe people disagree if a man's truly truly honest with himself he doesn't want to be with one girl for his whole life why why are they pretending like you may love a woman and you may want kids with a woman that's fine but to sit there hand on heart and say I never want to [ __ ] anyone else ever again is a [ __ ] lie it's a [ __ ] lie and you because societal pressure has come along and telling you you should think that way and that you're not normal if you think any other way people cave into it let me tell you something maybe that old dude would still want to [ __ ] his old wife he got a little bit of side [ __ ] now and then and his [ __ ] game was still on and he ain't [ __ ] his wife in a while and he just looked at some new titties he might maybe he'd want to do it but he's sitting there with the same [ __ ] old [ __ ] he's like "Oh I am bored of you i've had you for 43 years." And men evolutionarily from a [ __ ] meant to [ __ ] multiple girls from an anim animalistic perspective men are are meant to run around and we don't get pregnant we're meant to run around and impregnate females and don't give a [ __ ] like every other [ __ ] mammal on Earth look at mammals that's what they do they run they get pregnant they just run off they don't care so yeah society and blah blah blah we're a little bit more sophisticated than animals but to sit there and pretend we do not have a biological urge to [ __ ] multiple females is [ __ ] it's [ __ ] garbage and that's why if I ever get married which will never happen because I don't believe it has any benefits whatsoever even if I have a long Well I do have a long-term girlfriend and she's effectively my wife she knows I'm going to [ __ ] girls that's what I'm going to do and our relationship is happier if I do that because trust me if I don't do that I'm going miserable exactly so what's the point you know it's going to be sitting there [ __ ] miserable looking at your stupid ass thinking I can go get [ __ ] 10 girls be single mold literally so yeah man it's [ __ ] it's it's all garbage the Western world is absolutely a trap and the trap is designed specifically for men i watched a really interesting documentary on how to make a country rich how to make a country poor i was living in Thailand which is a poor country i was like well everyone knows the [ __ ] like the west colonialized other countries we went there we stole their wealth all this garbage which isn't really completely true i was like how to make a country rich out of a country poor what it does is it hypothetically starts a brand new country gets an island and starts it from the ground up it says "How do I ensure this is a rich country?" So there's some basic things like weather like the weather of Great Britain is actually perfect weather for money and the reason for that is because it's cold which which is cold is really important for the mindset of a human being because if you live in the in the the heat like they did in Africa you don't have to think ahead you get hungry you go get something from the tree you eat it whereas in a cold climate you think "Okay [ __ ] i need a house cuz it's going to be cold next year i better grow crops and it has to be seasonal because the the cold is coming and I got I got to find a way to preserve my meat cuz I won't be able to get any in the winter i got to chop trees." And you're constantly thinking ahead and preparing because of the because of the climate so this is very important that it's it's a thing it can't be too cold because it's cold all the time then you don't have the ability to build ships so England has the perfect weather regards it has seasons it's pretty cold you need shelter you need to think ahead but also you have freshwater ports all the way around so you can you can sail this is why England became so powerful it's the most power the largest empire in history was Britain because we had fuckles of boats turned over places this is ours now so uh this is how we do in clubs basically what we do now yeah so the the weather is a super important part but the most and there's a few other things which ways the rivers flow the rivers have to flow out not in Russia's flow in the wrong direction for example yeah they're saying the rivers flow in the opposite direction Russia should be twice as rich and little things like that but um the most interesting thing was the psychology of the people and they're saying that that to ensure the wealth of a nation the psychology of the people have to be completely and utterly believing that if they work hard enough somehow they will no longer be depressed and literally says that to It says clinical depression they call it rich land say clinical depression will be rife in richland they say we will make stupid people idiots celebrities in richland we will convince men that if they go to work and they work hard enough that one day they'll have a Ferrari 99.9% of them will never have the Ferrari and then they will die in Richland like it goes through the [ __ ] basics of how people just go to work and they dream if they work hard enough and they keep doing their desk job one day they're going to pull it off and it's going to come together and when they finally get this thing they'll be happy and they'll link happiness to consumer goods and they'll make consumer goods without outside of the reach of most people and that's how you keep them [ __ ] slaving away in rich land you have to watch it man it probably makes it probably puts into perspective how people are getting it's rich google rich and it also explains why these [ __ ] morons are famous there's no coincidence they make complete [ __ ] noise now I'm curious about that what do you mean what did they say about that so they're saying that by making absolute idiots if they made the people who are curing cancer famous you wouldn't feel any type of envy towards him because you'd say "Okay this person feel like he's brilliant he's brilliant and he's smarter than me." So take an average person make them famous and then other people go "Well I can do that too oh I can do that too." Or even worse what they're doing is they're instilling envy well that [ __ ] moron's famous and I still have nothing with my life how does he have things maybe if I get Ferrari I'll be I'll be somebody it's it's all that it's back into the consumer trap right back into the consumer trap like this nobody has all this so how can I there must be a way I can get all this and that that instills people to be hey it works instilled us to be [ __ ] consumerists and [ __ ] think of our own ways to become millionaires we both sat there thinking I need money so we fell into the trap like everyone else but we won the game but we won the game most people don't win the game you guys will though so you follow this advice absolutely so you look at the game and you understand that it's absolutely rigged for people to be entrepreneurial and people to [ __ ] do anything it takes to get cash which is good for the country but only a few people the 0.1% like us win the rest of them are still stuck there going "Well you know what yeah maybe in a couple years I'm going to have that and they ain't going to they're never going to get it." And on top of that they get married to [ __ ] then it talks about the sociode demographics of why uh one man must marry one woman oh they went into that they go into that as well yeah because it's good for a country if one man marries one woman this is this is the whole thing about [ __ ] want to like if everyone was in G like legitimately the world would be burnt it'd be [ __ ] cuz we're not going to be like standing on a [ __ ] telephone pole changing wires and [ __ ] like they need those worker bees 100% you need worker bees and there's and and who think you maybe I'll work hard and I'll get a bonus and my wife will be happy and give me a [ __ ] absolutely you need to have a hier you need a hierarchy of of people i know that's how it is and there are people down there who are happy with a lower level overall life and that's fine and that's fine that's your choice exactly but we'd never wanted to be that person but but um if if every man was completely true to his biological instinct and just run around [ __ ] who he wanted and wasn't loyal to any of the women then we'd have a whole shitload of kids who's going to look after the the women it would be a disaster it' be a disaster it' be like Africa exactly happening right there now literally that's really what it is those dudes [ __ ] about the kids no one knows who they are they're all blacks and whatever but um like and uh it's very important for the western for a civilized society that they convince men you must be with this girl you stay with her you have the kids yeah she's fat yeah she doesn't love you yeah the kids hate you but you can't leave her cuz you're feeding them kids you're feeding her and you're paying your tax so you're you're depressed and you're suicidal that's fine as long as you keep this little unit this little block that fits into the societal wall correct and that's why it's all all [ __ ] It's all garbage man the way we do we make money [ __ ] from the sky running around [ __ ] all these hoes the whole world was like us the whole world was like us today [ __ ] I don't know four four I think it's like 2:30 but um yeah we're not we're not we're not good for society but we are what we are is we're good for our own health exactly we're good for ourselves your own sanity cuz some people are not programmed to be the workaround in society exactly some people just aren't programmed to do it and I knew that after getting fired from like the 30th job i'm like I'm just not designed to work for someone absolutely this is this is not going to work and you and and when I say you see this in everyone anyway this is why people go traveling like I'm going traveling but why what are you looking for you're not looking for anything you're trying to run away from a life of responsibility that's all it is they're desperate to go Thailand and live for [ __ ] 200 years on $10 because I can't afford to do anything else but really what years but when I sit there and I talk to these people all they're they're reconfirming everything I'm saying now they don't want to but they just don't know they don't know it they don't see it they don't see a way out and they think the answer is to go become enlightened getting [ __ ] drunk in Thailand it's like whatever but but it's I'll go get drunk i'm gonna get enlightened i'm not pretending I'm learning these days i'm just out there getting drunk it's like whatever but exactly but yeah this is this is the reality of the world and this is the reality of especially if you're living in a rich country so you have to understand the game is rigged and you have to try your best to beat it and that is that's literally invaluable advice because you've probably been taught so many times by teachers who drive [ __ ] cars even you know we love parents but they can be good well-intentioned y but are they [ __ ] rich exactly if not then don't listen to their money advice just being honest absolutely you know what I mean like all these people when your friends when you start breaking free watch this course you actually implement it don't just watch it and sit there and jerk off watch it and implement it you're going to have friends oh man like you're different now man like you used to be cool because people start seeing their friends break free and they go into panic mode because it's basically a mirror on their life that they're not doing [ __ ] [ __ ] your friends y if your friends are like that they're not real friends you'll find new friends absolutely how many friends do you have like legitimate you got friends but you know what I mean if the higher you get you're going to have less people to hang out with so then you link up with other G's why do you think we're hanging out that's how it goes because otherwise you're going to all that's two things going to happen either like you said you're going to have to meet new people because you're either going to have a complete bunch of hate for your old friends or you're gonna have to [ __ ] finance their life forever and that's going to get old and that gets old i mean I had some friends and they're cool and we're cool thing but you get to a point and they're nowhere and they're still cool if I'm buying their holidays but then when you're not they're a bit like oh you're always busy like I'm not I'm busy paying get some money you can come the [ __ ] busy [ __ ] Caribbean get the [ __ ] over here so yeah and you're right people don't want to the easiest way to make someone feel bad about themselves is is to out is to excel above them start in the same place and win the race they don't want that your friends won't try and drag you down any way they can everyone wants to drag you down like everybody like when I was fighting professionally people saying I I the number one thing I saw that ruined fighters and there's other fighters in my camp or other fighters number one thing I saw was girlfriends because their girlfriend just didn't want them succeeding or being [ __ ] You think "Oh your girl wants you to be world champion." No she [ __ ] doesn't your girls don't want you rich and [ __ ] surrounded by ring girls and traveling the world she wants you at home they secretly lust after those guys without a doubt they don't actually want you to do it because they know you're going to have options and when a man has options what does he have power y and then he can really choose cuz a lot of dudes with girlfriends are [ __ ] tied to that one girl and she knows it and she enjoys having that control absolutely they don't want you to [ __ ] become someone of of super high value all of a sudden out of nowhere so these girls and you're what you said the lusting is crazy they'll sit there and do their best to stop you becoming somebody like that and then [ __ ] someone like that behind your back exactly it's [ __ ] madness so the number of girls number of number of girls I had to get rid of and they try and disguise it as dumb [ __ ] like I used to train from 8:00 till 9:30 so I had some girls [ __ ] she was she was hot she was nine in London i said I picked up a 10 she goes 10 i was like well yeah 10 that's when I finished training she oh so I'm a booty call so you're not a booty call i'm picking up at 10 cuz I have to finish gym well why do you have to train today cuz I got to [ __ ] fight [ __ ] you're trying to prevent me from training just any way you can like you're like "Fuck you bye." Like but this is how they'll do it i've seen so many fighters literally collapse to that influence for me their [ __ ] [ __ ] girlfriends ruins their career like "Oh I have to start changing my training times for some [ __ ] hoe you think she's going to save you when I'm when someone's punching your [ __ ] face in you think she's going to jump in the ring and save you [ __ ] that [ __ ] you're training what the fuck?" Crazy well that's why you're the four time world champion and this is and it's the same with everything man it's the same with like you're saying friends and like you're saying parents are are well-intentioned but they don't always instill freedom inside of you they especially if your parents followed the pre-prescribed depending on their age too like the baby boomer thing was all go to college if you went to college wow you're going to get out and the whole thing here think I want you to think bigger think of this you know you probably you've heard of this for sure but in America it's like six figures that is the six figures make a hundred or 100,000 that's make a 100,000 a year and you've made it 100,000 a year in New York is nothing it's like [ __ ] with the poverty line so think [ __ ] bigger don't limit yourself based on what society says cuz you know what think of this trap 100,000 a year cool BMW nice apartment it keeps you enslaved because then what do they call it golden handcuffs so you got to keep making that 120,000 a year so you can keep up your BMW and your little vacation to Vegas every couple months whatever but you're never really breaking the [ __ ] free absolutely you're not cuz you're still [ __ ] turning up all the time at this [ __ ] job you're still working with people you hate and doing [ __ ] you don't want to do and then you could say "I love my job." You don't love your job cuz if you had unlimited money would you still go do your job no you don't love it and it's the middle the middle class are the ones who [ __ ] fund these these governments the poor people exist to scare the middle class and the rich people exist to inspire the middle class but the money comes from the middle class the rich people ain't paying all that tax and the poor people ain't paying it mr bmw Mr 100,000 Mr successful is the guy who's really giving up his life to put money in the [ __ ] government bank to [ __ ] drop bombs on [ __ ] o it's crazy so you're right successful in many terms of the word isn't success i used to say this to Tristan before I had money we were in Slovakia one time and we were some guy came up and asked spoke in Slovak i said "I don't speak so." And he said in perfect English perfect English he goes "Can I have some money for vodka?" Honest i was like I was like "You know what?" I said "My life's pretty good like I have a house and even I want vodka so you must really want vodka." He's like "Exactly." I said "Let's go get some vodka." So I bought the dude who bought the vodka and I said to Tristan was it like a dollar yeah literally i was like in many ways I see this guy as more successful than the BMW guy cuz he does he doesn't answer to nobody he does what the [ __ ] he wants yeah he's homeless whatever but he's his time is completely free he lives on his own terms he does what he decided you know say he has asked for a bottle of woke he got it so he's happy today like you have to completely judge success my view of success was never just have money because I could have [ __ ] done a million corporate jobs and had money it was be free this is why you're saying freedom freedom is not This is why a lot of people talk about getting their own business because it's one of the only ways you could somehow find a way to to to delink your time and your money are you free if you're a banker i know bankers in [ __ ] London they have money but they have to catch the [ __ ] NASDAQ Wall Street the British exchange and the Japanese exchange they're in the [ __ ] office at like 4:30 in the morning and they leave at like 9 10 at night they're the [ __ ] six days a week if they don't do it someone take a job so it's like are you free where's your life true measure of status nowadays is your time that is the ultimate level of status i don't give a [ __ ] if you're a heart surgeon or whatever yeah when you are tied to something these doctors I know this heart surgeon he's got like a little be whatever not a beeper but like what however they do it now literally will be on a date we have to get up and go to the hospital now he loves what he does like truly loves it and I respect that if you love being an accountant or love being a post office worker great but let's be honest 99.9% of people don't actually love what they do absolutely they have to do what they do so to wrap it up [ __ ] look at your life and think what do you really want to do there really are no barriers the only barriers exist in your mind it's not [ __ ] it's facts be realistic in the sense I wouldn't be like "Oh I'm going to go into the NBA it's just [ __ ] [ __ ] i hate basketball anyway." But seriously you know in terms of money in terms of women you have to really think what do I want not my parents not my brother not my cousin Kathy not my [ __ ] girlfriend who barely licks my balls chick this morning was sucking on the balls bro i did the face on face off i do the face on wax on wax off you've probably never done this take your balls rub them on their face like this wax on wax off dead serious they love it i'm going to wrap it up with that no but you're you're absolutely No no no completely right man like be honest with yourself i always do a Wanda Harim i'm here so [ __ ] it what do you call it harim Harm yeah like shakes and like the old in the old It's haram isn't it harimm yeah harm haram harim i like harim though it has more of a royal sound to it well I always knew I wanted it even when I had no money i was never the one girl i was always like "One day I'm going to have myself a bunch of bad bitches." And then like "Yeah all right man you can't pay the rent." Like "You're scam." And there you are here we go moldova bro.
